RIT Professor Leads Study of Under-investigated Languages|01|Jan. 05, 2011|William Dube|A key concept in the field of linguistics is sentence structure and its impact on linguistic performance. For example, languages such as English and French place critical information early in a phrase|, which facilitates both human comprehension and machine translation. In comparison, languages such as Japanese, Hindi and Basque place critical information at the end of a phrase or a sentence—posing a challenge in machine translation. How native speakers effortlessly comprehend and speak those languages also has not been well understood.</p><p>Processing and Producing Head-final Structures is a new collection of writings by leading scholars in the field co-edited by Rochester Institute of Technology professor Hiroko Yamashita. It is one of the first to comprehensively examine the processing and production of specific linguistic structures called “head-final structures” in different languages.</p><p>“In linguistic study, languages are broken down into two types: head-initial, where the linguistic head, such as the verb, comes before the complement, and head-final, where the head usually is at the end of a phrase,” notes Yamashita, chair of the RIT Department of Modern Languages and Cultures.</p><p>“Until recently, progress in the field of human sentence processing has been achieved largely by investigating head-initial languages such as English,” she continues. “The goal of this collection is to deepen our understanding by examining how humans comprehend or speak head-final languages such as Japanese, Korean, German and Hindi, and offering a comparison of those results to findings from head-initial languages.”</p><p>The book is co-edited by Yuki Hirose, associate professor of language and information sciences at the University of Tokyo, and Jerome Packard, professor of East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It grew out of the International Conference on Processing Head-final Structures, a National Science Foundation sponsored symposium held at RIT in 2007.</p>
Student&#039;s Paper on Heat Transfer Technology Takes Top Honors|02|Jan. 05, 2011|Michelle Cometa|Dwight Cooke, a graduate student in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, won the top award for his research paper at the recent American Indian Science| and Engineering Society Conference, held this year in Albuquerque, N.M. It was the second time his work on heat transfer for electronics cooling received the designation at the national conference.</p><p>Cooke made a presentation based on his paper, “Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Over Micro-grooved Surfaces.” In it, he evaluated silicon chips with different surface geometries and tested them under boiling conditions to look at how effective they are at heat transfer.</p><p>“It was really surprising to win for a second year,” says Cooke, who won in the graduate student category. “Last year they had awards for just an overall graduate presentation, but this year it was categorized between master’s-level and Ph.D.-level presentations.”</p><p>The conference hosts Native American, First Nations and Native Hawaiian students from universities around the country to highlight their academic achievements in science, technology, engineering and mathematical disciplines and to encourage their growth as future leaders of tribal communities. This year, more than 1,800 students participated.</p><p>“What was really nice was being able to go to the conference with the other students in RIT’s chapter and the faculty advisers from the Future Stewards Program. We were able to meet other students from different schools, and I realized that through the Future Stewards Program, RIT has more outreach for Native Americans compared to other universities,” says Cooke, who is a St. Regis Mohawk Tribe member who grew up in Castleton, N.Y. “We recruit students from the high school level, but also have the Native American Advisory Council, which puts in place a framework of cooperation between the leaders of the Haudenosaunee nations, state government officials and President Destler.”</p><p>Cooke has been an active member of the research work done at the Thermal Analysis, Microfluidics and Fuel Cell Lab in the engineering college since 2007. He began as a co-op student working with Satish Kandlikar, professor of mechanical engineering and one of the foremost researchers in fuel-cell technologies.</p><p>“I work on heat transfer analysis for chip cooling,” Cooke explains. “I had a co-op in the lab as an undergraduate, and was working on fuel cells, but now my thesis topic is about maximum heat transfer and boiling properties. Studies like this one are most important for people researching electronic chip cooling, but boiling also has other applications for nuclear power generation and even inkjet printing.”</p><p>Over the summer, Cooke joined Kandlikar at the 8th Annual International Conference on Nano-channels, Micro-channels and Mini-channels in Montreal and co-presented “Pool Boiling Heat Transfer and Bubble Dynamics Over Plain and Enhanced Microchannels.”</p><p>“Dr. Kandlikar has helped me to produce a conference paper as well as a journal paper out of my research,” says Cooke. “My plan is to finish my thesis and graduate at the end of the winter quarter.”</p>
Osher at RIT Offers Classes to Shake the Winter Doldrums|03|Dec. 21, 2010|Marcia Morphy|Want to discuss Irish history, poetry or current events in science and technology?</p><p>If you’re age 50 or older and wish to take advantage of classes and other activities that spark intellectual stimulation| in the arts, literature, sciences, history and government—then Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at RIT is the place for you.</p><p>A free open house showcasing winter classes will be held from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Jan. 10-13, and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Jan. 14. New participants are invited to bring a brown bag lunch, stay the day and socialize with Osher at RIT members.</p><p>Classes run the gamut from Ancient China to Sports in America and Taxes and Tax Policy. This week’s featured guest for the popular Pfaudler Enrichment Series is Peter Lovenheim, author of In the Neighborhood: The Search for Community on an American Street, One Sleepover at a Time, who will discuss his book from noon to 1 p.m. Jan. 13.</p><p>Winter classes run from Jan. 10 through March 11 and are held at the Athenaeum Building in the Riparian Independent Living Complex at Rivers Run, 50 Fairwood Drive, Suite 100. Free parking is available and new members are always welcome. For information, call 585-292-8989 or go to www.osher.rit.edu.</p><p>Note: Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at RIT is a membership-led organization that stimulates minds and forges friendships among people ages 50 and older who live in greater Rochester. The organization was founded in 1987 as The Athenaeum, an affiliate of Rochester Institute of Technology. In 2006, it became an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, joining a growing national network of more than 100 university-based centers.</p>
Trimming the Perfect Holiday Tree&#8722;RIT Style|04|Dec. 02, 2010|John Follaco|Boughs of holly may deck most halls this time of year, but the Women in Computing group at Rochester Institute of Technology has some different holiday décor in mind. The B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information| Sciences atrium will feature a Techie Tree—a holiday tree adorned with ornaments made out of computer hardware.</p><p>Students, faculty and staff will gather for a Techie Tree decorating party from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. Dec. 6 in the Golisano Hall atrium. They will create ornaments and trim the tree.</p><p>“We have a bunch of computer parts, media and other electronic devices that we’ve taken apart and will turn them into a holiday ornament,” says Sandra Murphy, Women in Computing’s program coordinator. “We’ll add some craft supplies and transform the hardware into something different…a snow flake, a Santa face or something like that.”</p><p>RIT’s Women in Computing group regularly holds events that are designed to facilitate the advancement of women in the computing field. Most of these events focus on professional development, but Murphy sees the Techie Tree decorating party as something different.</p><p>“This is an opportunity for us to get together socially and network in more of a casual, relaxed setting. It’s a great opportunity for students to connect with faculty, staff and each other,” says Murphy.</p>
