Trimming the Perfect Holiday Tree&#8722;RIT Style|1|Dec. 02, 2010|John Follaco|Boughs of holly may deck most halls this time of year, but the Women in Computing group at Rochester Institute of Technology has some different holiday décor in mind. The B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information| Sciences atrium will feature a Techie Tree—a holiday tree adorned with ornaments made out of computer hardware.<br /><br />Students, faculty and staff will gather for a Techie Tree decorating party from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. Dec. 6 in the Golisano Hall atrium. They will create ornaments and trim the tree.<br /><br />“We have a bunch of computer parts, media and other electronic devices that we’ve taken apart and will turn them into a holiday ornament,” says Sandra Murphy, Women in Computing’s program coordinator. “We’ll add some craft supplies and transform the hardware into something different…a snow flake, a Santa face or something like that.”<br /><br />RIT’s Women in Computing group regularly holds events that are designed to facilitate the advancement of women in the computing field. Most of these events focus on professional development, but Murphy sees the Techie Tree decorating party as something different.<br /><br />“This is an opportunity for us to get together socially and network in more of a casual, relaxed setting. It’s a great opportunity for students to connect with faculty, staff and each other,” says Murphy.

RIT Selects James Winebrake as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts|3|Jan. 04, 2011|William Dube|James Winebrake, a noted transportation and energy policy scholar, has been named dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Rochester Institute of Technology. Winebrake will develop and implement the college’s |strategic plan and lead RIT’s research and education initiatives in the humanities, social sciences and performing/fine arts.<br /><br />“James Winebrake is an accomplished scholar and teacher and has been an integral part of RIT’s research and educational mission for close to a decade,” notes Jeremy Haefner, RIT provost. “I am proud to name him as the new dean of liberal arts and look forward to working with him to promote the further development of the college and RIT as a whole.”<br /><br />Winebrake was chosen following an open search that included input from faculty, staff and students, which led to the selection of four finalists to be reviewed by the provost. Winebrake will begin his new duties Jan. 10.<br /><br />“I am very honored to be selected for this post and will seek to work with the administration as well as the college’s faculty, staff and students to advance education and scholarship in the arts, humanities and social sciences while also promoting interdisciplinary initiatives across RIT’s nine colleges,” Winebrake says.<br /><br />For the past eight years, Winebrake has served as chair of RIT’s Department of Science, Technology and Society/Public Policy, where he led efforts to develop and expand curricular offerings at the undergraduate and graduate level.<br /><br />He has earned international recognition for his research on issues related to the environmental impacts of goods movement, the effectiveness of transportation subsidies and public polices related to alternative energy development. He is a member of the National Research Council’s Committee on the Study of Potential Energy Savings and Greenhouse Gas Reductions from Transportation and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Transportation Energy Futures Steering Committee.<br /><br />Prior to joining RIT, Winebrake served as an associate professor of public policy at James Madison University. He received a bachelor’s degree in physics from Lafayette College, a master’s in technology and policy from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. in energy management and policy from the University of Pennsylvania.
RIT Professor Leads Study of Under-investigated Languages|4|Jan. 05, 2011|William Dube|A key concept in the field of linguistics is sentence structure and its impact on linguistic performance. For example, languages such as English and French place critical information early in a phrase|, which facilitates both human comprehension and machine translation. In comparison, languages such as Japanese, Hindi and Basque place critical information at the end of a phrase or a sentence—posing a challenge in machine translation. How native speakers effortlessly comprehend and speak those languages also has not been well understood.<br /><br />Processing and Producing Head-final Structures is a new collection of writings by leading scholars in the field co-edited by Rochester Institute of Technology professor Hiroko Yamashita. It is one of the first to comprehensively examine the processing and production of specific linguistic structures called “head-final structures” in different languages.<br /><br />“In linguistic study, languages are broken down into two types: head-initial, where the linguistic head, such as the verb, comes before the complement, and head-final, where the head usually is at the end of a phrase,” notes Yamashita, chair of the RIT Department of Modern Languages and Cultures.<br /><br />“Until recently, progress in the field of human sentence processing has been achieved largely by investigating head-initial languages such as English,” she continues. “The goal of this collection is to deepen our understanding by examining how humans comprehend or speak head-final languages such as Japanese, Korean, German and Hindi, and offering a comparison of those results to findings from head-initial languages.”<br /><br />The book is co-edited by Yuki Hirose, associate professor of language and information sciences at the University of Tokyo, and Jerome Packard, professor of East Asian languages and cultures at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It grew out of the International Conference on Processing Head-final Structures, a National Science Foundation sponsored symposium held at RIT in 2007.
Student&#039;s Paper on Heat Transfer Technology Takes Top Honors|5|Jan. 05, 2011|Michelle Cometa|Dwight Cooke, a graduate student in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, won the top award for his research paper at the recent American Indian Science| and Engineering Society Conference, held this year in Albuquerque, N.M. It was the second time his work on heat transfer for electronics cooling received the designation at the national conference.<br /><br />Cooke made a presentation based on his paper, “Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Over Micro-grooved Surfaces.” In it, he evaluated silicon chips with different surface geometries and tested them under boiling conditions to look at how effective they are at heat transfer.<br /><br />“It was really surprising to win for a second year,” says Cooke, who won in the graduate student category. “Last year they had awards for just an overall graduate presentation, but this year it was categorized between master’s-level and Ph.D.-level presentations.”<br /><br />The conference hosts Native American, First Nations and Native Hawaiian students from universities around the country to highlight their academic achievements in science, technology, engineering and mathematical disciplines and to encourage their growth as future leaders of tribal communities. This year, more than 1,800 students participated.<br /><br />“What was really nice was being able to go to the conference with the other students in RIT’s chapter and the faculty advisers from the Future Stewards Program. We were able to meet other students from different schools, and I realized that through the Future Stewards Program, RIT has more outreach for Native Americans compared to other universities,” says Cooke, who is a St. Regis Mohawk Tribe member who grew up in Castleton, N.Y. “We recruit students from the high school level, but also have the Native American Advisory Council, which puts in place a framework of cooperation between the leaders of the Haudenosaunee nations, state government officials and President Destler.”<br /><br />Cooke has been an active member of the research work done at the Thermal Analysis, Microfluidics and Fuel Cell Lab in the engineering college since 2007. He began as a co-op student working with Satish Kandlikar, professor of mechanical engineering and one of the foremost researchers in fuel-cell technologies.<br /><br />“I work on heat transfer analysis for chip cooling,” Cooke explains. “I had a co-op in the lab as an undergraduate, and was working on fuel cells, but now my thesis topic is about maximum heat transfer and boiling properties. Studies like this one are most important for people researching electronic chip cooling, but boiling also has other applications for nuclear power generation and even inkjet printing.”<br /><br />Over the summer, Cooke joined Kandlikar at the 8th Annual International Conference on Nano-channels, Micro-channels and Mini-channels in Montreal and co-presented “Pool Boiling Heat Transfer and Bubble Dynamics Over Plain and Enhanced Microchannels.”<br /><br />“Dr. Kandlikar has helped me to produce a conference paper as well as a journal paper out of my research,” says Cooke. “My plan is to finish my thesis and graduate at the end of the winter quarter.”
Classical Composer David Liptak Explores New Avenues in Contemporary Music|6|Jan. 27, 2011|William Dube|Award-winning composer David Liptak, who is considered one of the leading lights in contemporary classical music, will visit Rochester Institute of Technology on Feb. 2 as part of the Caroline Werner |Gannett Project’s “Visionaries in Motion IV” speaker series.<br /><br />His presentation “Composing New Music” with pianist Zuzanna Szewczyk includes an examination of the composing process and will offer selections from new and old compositions. The free public lecture will be held at 8 p.m. in Ingle Auditorium in the Student Alumni Union.<br /><br />In conjunction with the talk, two of Liptak’s former students, Jamie Jordan, soprano, and Daniel Pesca, pianist/composer, will present the recital 30 Years of American Song at 7 p.m. Jan. 26 in the Student Alumni Union Music Room at RIT.<br /><br />Music critic John Pitcher has called Liptak’s compositions “contemporary music at its level best,” and his works have been performed by a host of national and international orchestras, including the San Francisco Symphony, the Montreal Symphony, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the Chamber Society of Lincoln Center, and by a host of additional soloists and ensembles.<br /><br />Liptak has received commissions from the Fromm Foundation, the California Music Center and the Hanson Institute for American Music and his compositions have appeared on close to a dozen recordings over the last 30 years. His many tributes include the Elise L. Stoeger Prize, the Lillian Fairchild Award and an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<br /><br />Liptak is also a noted music educator and has served as a professor of composition at the Eastman School of Music since 1986.<br /><br />The Gannett Project’s Visionaries in Motion series explores new connections across technologies, social sciences and humanities, increasing opportunities for interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration both on campus and in the Greater Rochester community. In 2009, the series was selected as City newspaper’s Critics’ Pick for “Best Lecture Series in Rochester.” All Gannett events are free and open to the public.
Exotic Cars Drive this Photo Graduate|7|Jan. 27, 2011|Kathy Lindsley|When Michael Furman was about 12 years old, he saw an orange, 1963 split-window Corvette roll down the street. “We all reached for cameras,” says Furman ’74 (photography). That was 45| years ago. Today, Furman is world-renowned for his photos of classic automobiles.<br /><br />In collaboration with leading museums and collectors, he has produced nine high-end books, which he describes as “photographic essays on cars.” Titles include Speed, Style and Beauty, the Cars of the Ralph Lauren Collection, produced for a 2005 exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Curves of Steel, for a 2007 exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum; The Art and Colour of General Motors, celebrating the company’s centennial in 2008; and most recently, The Art of Bugatti: Mullin Automotive Museum, released in conjunction with the 2010 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, the prestigious annual classic car event.<br /><br />Noted car collector Jay Leno, who has interviewed Furman several times, calls him “one of the great, great automotive photographers.”<br /><br />Furman creates his gorgeous, meticulous images using still-life techniques he began to develop at RIT. Initially, he was interested in photojournalism. But, in what he calls “one of the landmark moments of my life,” a professor steered him away from photojournalism. Furman turned his efforts to fine art and commercial photography.<br /><br />After graduation, Furman lived briefly in New York City with friends before returning home to Philadelphia. But he continued to use a New York phone number, which he believes carried some weight with potential clients. He began to get some assignments, and his career took off.<br /><br />“Back then, art directors were interested in looking for new talent. They were willing to take risks,” he says. “I was very, very lucky.”<br /><br />Furman has shot the gamut of subjects for a wide variety of clients. The automotive specialty began with a small assignment for Mercedes-Benz. Since then, he’s worked for Jaguar, BMW North America and many others.<br /><br />Furman’s goal is to “capture the essence of these amazing vehicles. Truth is beauty and elegance is simple beauty.” Although he’s photographed hundreds of exotic cars from the world’s foremost collections, his enthusiasm remains strong. “I can think of dozens of cars I would like to photograph,” he says. “I’m not going to live long enough to accomplish everything on my list.”
Graduate Becomes Debt-buster Guru|8|Jan. 27, 2011|Mindy Mozer|Pay off $70,000 of debt in less than two years. Check. Quit a six-figure-income job that isn’t rewarding. Check. Work 20 hours a week from home, spend quality time with family and begin |working on becoming an eventual millionaire. Check, check, check.<br /><br />Meet Jaime Tardy ’04 (information technology), who is getting a national reputation as a debt buster. She started a blog, eventualmillionaire.com, and has been interviewed by CNNMoney.com, CNN Newsroom and Yahoo! Finance about paying off debt and living a more fulfilling life.<br /><br />Tardy landed the high-paying job after graduation. She worked as an engineer and then project manager for a video-on-demand company. She traveled around the country and rarely saw her husband, Matt, who works as a performing artist. In 2006, the couple wanted to start a family, and Jaime Tardy knew she needed to make a change.<br /><br />But first they had to pay off about $70,000 in debt—$26,180 in school loans, a $19,300 car loan and $24,560 for a home equity loan.<br /><br />They traded in their new Honda Civic for a 2000 Jeep Cherokee. They canceled cable, lowered their cell phone bills, sold other items they didn’t need and went on a strict budget that included spending only $300 a month on groceries. The couple played a game in the grocery store adding up the bill in their heads to stay on track and make the budget more fun.<br /><br />“The hardest thing is making it habit,” Tardy says.<br /><br />Tardy worked almost 70 hours a week to make extra money.<br /><br />When their son was 4 months old in 2007, they became debt free. Today, at the age of 28 and now with two children, Tardy remains debt free.<br /><br />Tardy, who lives near Auburn, Maine, works 20 hours a week from home as a business coach and a financial blogger. In her blog, she tells her story and gives tips on how to cut costs and plan for the unexpected.<br /><br />The family is still on a tight budget—the monthly grocery budget is now up to $500. Tardy says she plans all meals and sticks to a list.<br /><br />“My goal was to quit my job and work 20 hours a week,” Tardy says. “Being on the other side of that is really cool. But I still have the goal to be an eventual millionaire. I have more to do.”<br /><br />To learn more, go to eventualmillionaire.com.<br /><br />Here are some tips from Jaime Tardy from eventualmillionaire.com.<br /><br />1. The pain of getting out of debt is temporary. We made the decision to never get into debt again. Once that $70,000 was gone, it would be gone for good.<br /><br />2. You don’t need to live for tomorrow. My husband wasn’t on board at first. He said, “Why live for tomorrow when you could die today?” He had a valid point. What I realized was that, if we didn’t at least try to do it and work toward our goals, we would never live the life we truly wanted.<br /><br />3. Accountability and support really help. Telling people we were getting out of debt was important. My husband and I used each other as “accountability buddies.” He would check up on me and I would check up on him. He would support me when I was feeling down and vice versa.<br /><br />4. The learning curve feels very steep. It is so much easier to go back into the normal routine of buying a coffee or forgetting the budget at the beginning of the month. I promise you, it gets easier. I’ve been doing this for four years, and now I can sense when I need to create a budget. I automatically think about my personal fund when I go to Starbucks.<br /><br />5. You enjoy the simple things in life more. Selling a lot of our stuff made me appreciate how much we had that we never used. Even selling things that I loved (like the new car) made me realize what really mattered in life.
Grad Applies High-tech Training to Family Business|9|Jan. 27, 2011|Kathy Lindsley|After graduation, Luke M. Vaillancourt ’05, ’06 (print media, cross disciplinary studies) had numerous job offers—including digital asset coordinator with Victoria’s Secret in New York. Instea|d, he decided to return home.<br /><br />“The area has a ton of room for growth and I wanted to be a part of that wave,” he says.<br /><br />Home is Sutton, a small town near Worcester, Mass.<br /><br />Upon his return, he went to work as a cross-media designer for Palley Advertising in Worcester. In 2007, he joined the family business, Vaillancourt Folk Art in Sutton, as director of digital marketing. The company produces hand-decorated chalkware collectibles, particularly Christmas figures, which are sold through about 500 retailers nationwide, including Macy’s, Bergdorf’s, Neiman Marcus and Colonial Williamsburg.<br /><br />The company traces its roots to 1984, when Luke’s dad, Gary, gave his mom, Judi, three antique chocolate molds — the beginning of a collection that now numbers around 5,000 (some from as early as 1890). Judi used the molds to create plaster figures, hand-painting the intricate details. The business took off, receiving recognition from publications such as Early American Life and Colonial Homes.<br /><br />“We offer high quality, American-made pieces that can be passed down for generations,” says Vaillancourt. “Many people really appreciate that.”<br /><br />Today the company is housed in a 19th-century textile mill. The site includes the studio, gallery and a museum of antique molds. A Collector’s Weekend takes place each April, when people can attend lectures and paint their own figurines. The Christmas season brings additional events.<br /><br />The company has a high-tech side, and that’s where Vaillancourt comes in. He manages the company’s Web presence, e-commerce and business strategies. Recent efforts in social networking are allowing the company to reach a new generation.<br /><br />Vaillancourt got interested in technology as a student at Worcester Academy, where he helped to establish some of the school’s first wired classrooms, dorms and computer labs. Sparked by an interest in technology and passion for design and marketing, he and his family set off to visit 15 colleges around the world to find the right program.<br /><br />“When I got to RIT, it just blew me away,” Vaillancourt says. “The new media publishing program is unbelievable, very hands-on, combining creative, technical, and practical aspects to the industry—something that no other school could offer.”<br /><br />He focused on the technical side of advertising and marketing and, as an undergraduate, he co-authored Marketing4Digital: A Guide to Print Markets with Professor Frank J. Romano.<br /><br />Besides his work developing the family business, Vaillancourt is actively involved in the community. In 2008, he founded WorcesterScene.com, an online resource for Worcester restaurants, bars and cultural venues; it has been described as “Yellow Pages on steroids” because of its integration of video, promotions, social media and geo-targeted information. Vaillancourt remains involved in the Worcester community, sitting on the Members Council at the Worcester Art Museum and, this year, being elected to the Board of Trustees of Worcester Academy—as one of the youngest board members in the 175-year history of the private school.<br /><br />He marked an even more important personal milestone this year. In October, Vaillancourt and Anna Dufault were married in Newport, R.I.<br /><br />For more information, go to www.valfa.com.
