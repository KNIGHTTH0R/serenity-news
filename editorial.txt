<p>Welcome to one out of several of my sites. This site serves its purpose much differently from the others, as it actually contains more updateable content on the spot. As you can see here, it resembles a newspage. Although, it wouldn’t be updated as frequently as real webpages for newspaper are, it is still updateable to some degree. There is an “accurate” weather report for Rochester here at the very least. For the most part though, things on the administrator side that make this site updateable are located in the admin page: updating this editorial, adding a news post, adding banner styles, and updating advertisements. Older news articles would be located in the archives. There is also a comments page where you can comment on an article or anything on the site in general.</p><p>I am not going to waste anymore of your time here if you wanted to look around other parts of the site. If you wish to contact me, you may use the contact page to email me. Have a good day. <3</p>
