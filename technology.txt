A Record-Breaking New Year’s Eve for Twitter|1|Jan. 06, 2011|Nick Bilton|It didn’t take long for Twitter to break its own record as we rolled into 2011. The company said on Thursday that a mere four seconds after midnight in Japan, users set a new all-time record of the number of Tweets| sent per second across the social network.<br /><br />During its peak on New Year’s Eve, Twitter users were sending 6,939 Tweets per second. That adds up to more than 400,000 Twitter messages sent during a single minute of the new year.<br /><br />This new number shattered previous records of 3,283 Tweets sent per second, which were recorded during the Japanese versus Denmark game of the 2010 World Cup.<br /><br />You can see a fascinating video on the official Twitter blog, which visualizes New Year’s Eve Tweets sent from around the world.
Spamming Declines, at Least Temporarily|2|Jan. 06, 2011|Riva Richmond|Call it a Christmas gift from the cybercrime underground. The number of spam e-mail messages circulating on the Internet tumbled at the end of December after the world’s largest spamming operation mysteriously went dark| on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />A network of malware-infected computers known as the Rustock botnet, which is widely believed to be Russian-operated and had been responsible for about half of all spam across the globe, “appears to have completely gone of the map and is yet to resume,” said Matt Sergeant, senior anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs, a unit of the security-software maker Symantec.<br /><br />Rustock simply stopped sending spam, he said, adding that no one really knows why.<br /><br />It has, though, he said, continued to engage in another type of online crime known as click fraud, in which bogus clicks are used to defraud advertisers who pay for Web traffic by the click.<br /><br />At the same time, two other smaller botnets known for sending spam also dropped off for unknown reasons. The Lethic botnet went quiet on Dec. 28, and the Xarvester botnet on Dec. 31.<br /><br />“Did the people in charge of these botnets suddenly go on vacation? Symantec wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “Currently there are no explanations on why these botnets stopped spamming.”<br /><br />The upshot, though, is that global spam volumes dropped to about 30 billion messages a day from about 70 billion before Christmas, according to MessageLabs. The decline added to a downward trend under way since August, when spam peaked at some 200 billion spam messages a day, or 92.2 percent of all e-mail. The firm attributes the general decline to a reduction in spamming by botnets, which accounted for 88 percent of spam until their activity began trailing off in the latter part of the year.<br /><br />One theory for why Rustock and the other botnets stopped spamming is that an important source of business may have dried up. In late September, a large spam ring, SpamIt.com, ceased operations, after an investigation by Russian authorities. SpamIt had paid spammers to promote online pharmacies primarily. Without SpamIt, perhaps, “at least for now, there’s no content to fill the spamming cannons that Rustock has,” said John Reid, of Spamhaus, a nonprofit group that tracks spammers.<br /><br />Or they could be intimidated. In addition to going after the man behind SpamIt, Russian authorities recently arrested two spammers in Taganrog, a port town in southern Russia, who had a database of nearly two billion United States and European Union e-mail addresses they had used to spread malicious programs, according to a December report by the HostExploit blog.<br /><br />“Even if the people were unrelated, the chilling effect of arrests can cause others to lay-low for a while,” Mr. Reid said, adding, “But all this is speculation.”<br /><br />Or it could just be the calm before the storm. “They might be revamping for some new campaign,” said Andre’ M. Di Mino of The Shadowserver Foundation, a group that tracks malicious online activity. “They might be taking a break for awhile. But the infrastructure is still there. This just looks to be a pause.”<br /><br />Internet security experts did not think the decline will be permanent. “I honestly think the impact of this will be short lived,” Mr. Sergeant of MessageLabs said, pointing out that spamming is a lucrative business. Others will likely pick up where these groups left off, he said, and these groups could return to spamming at any time.<br /><br />“All we can do is enjoy this current calm and wait for it to start back up again,” he said.
Is It Finally Time for the Verizon iPhone?|3|Jan. 07, 2011|Miguel Helft|Just yesterday, Verizon’s top executives had the attention of the world’s technology press during a keynote speech and news conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The events left some disappointed: Verizon had little |new to announce, and in particular, there was no announcement about an iPhone running on Verizon Wireless.<br /><br />Now Verizon has invited reporters to an unexpected red carpet event at Lincoln Center in New York on Tuesday. Speculation is rampant across the Web that this time Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s president, will finally announce that the iPhone is coming to Verizon. And all signs suggest it is.<br /><br />A reporter for The Loop, a Web site dedicated to Apple news, was invited. Another Apple news site reports that employees of Verizon stores have been told to attend mandatory training sessions later this month for “an iconic pre-order.” And BoyGeniusReport, a gadget site, reports that Apple retail store employees have been barred from taking vacation in early February.<br /><br />So the consensus is that Mr. McAdam will announce the iPhone on Verizon on Tuesday and that the device will go on sale in a few weeks.<br /><br />A representative for Verizon did not immediately return a call for comment. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.<br /><br />We have known for some time that early this year Apple planned to make the iPhone available on Verizon, ending AT&T’s exclusivity on the coveted smartphone in the United States.<br /><br />But another question is whether Apple executives will be on stage at the New York event. Don’t count on Steven P. Jobs, the company’s chief executive, to be there. Apple typically announces new iPhone carriers through press releases. Then again, Verizon is not just another carrier. So perhaps another Apple executive will make the trip.<br /><br />Whatever the case, whenever the iPhone comes to Verizon, demand from customers is expected to be huge.
1986 Privacy Law Is Outrun by the Web|4|Jan. 09, 2011|Miguel Helft & Claire Cain Miller|SAN FRANCISCO — Concerned by the wave of requests for customer data from law enforcement agencies, Google last year set up an online tool showing the frequency of these requests in various countries. In the first| half of 2010, it counted more than 4,200 in the United States.<br /><br />Google is not alone among Internet and telecommunications companies in feeling inundated with requests for information. Verizon told Congress in 2007 that it received some 90,000 such requests each year. And Facebook told Newsweek in 2009 that subpoenas and other orders were arriving at the company at a rate of 10 to 20 a day.<br /><br />As Internet services — allowing people to store e-mails, photographs, spreadsheets and an untold number of private documents — have surged in popularity, they have become tempting targets for law enforcement. That phenomenon became apparent over the weekend when it surfaced that the Justice Department had sought the Twitter account activity of several people linked to WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy group.<br /><br />Many Internet companies and consumer advocates say the main law governing communication privacy — enacted in 1986, before cellphone and e-mail use was widespread, and before social networking was even conceived — is outdated, affording more protection to letters in a file cabinet than e-mail on a server.<br /><br />They acknowledge that access to information is important for fighting crime and terrorism, but say they are dealing with a patchwork of confusing standards that have been interpreted inconsistently by the courts, creating uncertainty.<br /><br />“Some people think Congress did a pretty good job in 1986 seeing the future, but that was before the World Wide Web,” said Susan Freiwald, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and an expert in electronic surveillance law. “The law can’t be expected to keep up without amendments.”<br /><br />Law enforcement agencies have reacted in the aftermath of 9/11 and argue the opposite side of the coin, fearing that changing communications technology will impede their access to crucial information.<br /><br />Last year, for example, the Justice Department argued in court that cellphone users had given up the expectation of privacy about their location by voluntarily giving that information to carriers. In April, it argued in a federal court in Colorado that it ought to have access to some e-mails without a search warrant. And federal law enforcement officials, citing technology advances, plan to ask for new regulations that would smooth their ability to perform legal wiretaps of various Internet communications.<br /><br />“When your job is to protect us by fighting and prosecuting crime, you want every tool available,” said Ryan Calo, director of the consumer privacy project at the Center for Internet & Society at Stanford Law School. “No one thinks D.O.J. and other investigative agencies are sitting there twisting their mustache trying to violate civil liberties. They’re trying to do their job.”<br /><br />Even Google, when it posted its online tool, acknowledged that the majority of requests it received “are valid and the information needed is for legitimate criminal investigations.”<br /><br />Still, Internet companies chafe at what they say is the weaker protection under the law afforded online data. They contend that an e-mail should have the same protection from law enforcement as the information stored in a home. They want law enforcement agencies to use a search warrant approved by a judge or a magistrate rather than rely on a simple subpoena from a prosecutor to obtain a person’s online data.<br /><br />While requests for information have become routine, the way Internet companies respond is not. In the WikiLeaks case, Twitter took the unusual step of seeking to unseal the court order so it could follow its own internal policies and notify its customers, the WikiLeaks members, that the government wanted information about them. Privacy experts praised Twitter for this.<br /><br />Most of the time, companies do no such thing; they are not required to do so under the patchwork of rules that govern law enforcement access to customer data.<br /><br />But as the data requests mount, companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook find themselves on the front lines of the tug of war between security concerns and the need to protect privacy.<br /><br />The rules established by the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act depend on what type of information is sought and how old it is. And courts in different jurisdictions have interpreted the rules differently.<br /><br />But in many cases, the government does not notify people that they are searching their online information or prove probable cause, and if the government violates the law in obtaining information, defendants are generally unable to exclude that evidence from a trial, Ms. Freiwald said.<br /><br />Generally law enforcement officials do not need a warrant to read e-mail messages that are more than 180 days old. This makes online surveillance different from surveillance of postal mail or phone calls. For example, when wiretapping phones, law enforcement must get a court order and when searching homes, they must obtain a warrant.<br /><br />At the same time, since the attacks of 9/11, it has become increasingly common for law enforcement to demand that its requests for information be sealed from the people who are the target of the investigation, as the Justice Department initially did in the WikiLeaks case.<br /><br />Facebook declined to comment on whether it had received requests for customer data linked to the WikiLeaks investigation. A company spokesman said Facebook had resisted “overly broad requests for user data.” Its privacy policy does not say whether the company will notify customers who are target of those requests.<br /><br />Google did not respond to requests for comment. Google’s privacy policy, like Facebook’s, alerts customers that it will comply “with valid legal processes seeking account information” but is silent on whether it will try to notify targets of an investigation.<br /><br />In contrast, Twitter’s policy “is to notify users of requests for their information prior to disclosure unless we are prohibited from doing so by statute or court order.”<br /><br />In the WikiLeaks case, Twitter has told the targets of the government investigation that it would turn over the information after 10 days unless they went to court to seek to block the release of the data, according to online postings by Birgitta Jonsdottir and Robbert Gonggrijp, two of the people who said they had received notices from Twitter.<br /><br />Electronic privacy and civil rights advocates say they worry that because the WikiLeaks court order gained such widespread attention, it could have a chilling effect on people’s speech on the Internet. But it could also teach unknowing Web users about the limits of the law, they said.<br /><br />In the absence of updated regulations, meanwhile, the tension between Internet companies and law enforcement is causing diplomatic strain as well. The Iceland government, of which Ms. Jonsdottir is a member, has said it will ask the American ambassador to explain the request for information about her. And in a recent post to Twitter, Ms. Jonsdottir said she was talking with American lawyers about her legal options.
A TV-Internet Marriage Awaits Blessings of All Parties|5|Jan. 09, 2011|Brian Stelter|LAS VEGAS — The blending of television and the Internet is inevitable. But will it happen in concert with the major cable and satellite distributors, or in spite of them? That question loomed large at the Consumer| Electronics Show last week as manufacturers promoted Internet-connected television sets and companies like Cisco and Sony talked about “redefining television.” All involved know that connecting the Internet to television and vice versa could solidify the distributors’ place in the food chain — or greatly erode it.<br /><br />“We want to use all this technology to make a better consumer experience,” Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said in an interview after speaking on stage here. A better experience, it stands to reason, will help Time Warner Cable and other cable companies retain customers, protecting the lucrative subscription TV business from the prospect of cord-cutting. It will also help manufacturers sell more hardware for the living room.<br /><br />During the trade show, however, there was a point in every demonstration where fantasy collided with reality — and it was usually when the cable and satellite distributors came up.<br /><br />“The idea here is to work with cable,” said Google’s Rishi Chandra as he showed off Google TV to Julius Genachowski, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, on Friday afternoon. When working together, Google TV can seamlessly find live television channels, recorded shows, on-demand options and Web streams. So far, though, it works that way only with Dish Network.<br /><br />“Right now,” Mr. Chandra said, “we’re limited.”<br /><br />After seeing television setups at the show, Mr. Genachowski said, “They’re incentivizing the cable companies to innovate.”<br /><br />At the show, media and technology executives largely agreed with that sentiment. And signs of innovation were evident: Time Warner Cable, one of the biggest cable operators, announced that it would start delivering programming via its network straight into some Sony and Samsung television sets, removing the need for a set-top cable television box.<br /><br />The so-called smart TVs receive video via the Internet, protect the video as directed by the content owners, and display it all with a program guide that is much slicker than the ones that most people are saddled with now. Time Warner Cable customers who buy the television sets will have a cable television app on the program guide next to a YouTube app and a Facebook app, all tied together by a search bar.<br /><br />Many distributors “will have an app for us” over time, predicted Stuart Silloway, a training manager for Samsung Electronics America.<br /><br />Also last week, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced that they would replicate their live channel lineups on tablet computers. Other distributors like Verizon and Cablevision are working on similar features. (Of course, the channels themselves are also scurrying to reach consumers on tablets, too.)<br /><br />The move onto tablets is part of a recognition by the Comcasts and Verizons of the world that they have to keep up with changing consumer habits.<br /><br />“If you buy a video subscription from us in your home, our goal is to make the video available on all your devices,” Mr. Britt of Time Warner said, echoing the goal of the “TV Everywhere” concept espoused by his and other companies. He added, “People don’t see PCs and phones and tablets and TVs as different things. They are all just video display devices.”<br /><br />Making a television subscription available on all those devices is wrenchingly difficult, because of a maze of copyrights and sometimes contradictory content strategies. At first, the live streams to tablets will be available only in customers’ homes, the distributors indicated last week. But that is still progress.<br /><br />Stand-alone boxes that bring the Internet to big-screen TVs have not caught on with the public, but including that functionality in televisions may make it more popular.<br /><br />It was learned last week that the remote controls for some Blu-ray players and connected televisions will come with red Netflix buttons this year, which is sure to “cause some consternation among those concerned about cable service cord-cutting,” wrote David Joyce of Miller Tabak and Company in an analyst’s note. But Mr. Joyce is optimistic that cable and satellite companies will adapt.<br /><br />Sensing a big business opportunity, companies are lining up to bolster “TV Everywhere” and, thus, the cable companies. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, proclaimed at a news conference Wednesday that “video is the next voice.” He said that Cisco had a software and hardware architecture package called Videoscape to blend television and Internet video sources.<br /><br />In demonstrations, Cisco imagined an on-screen guide with three columns — the largest column being the television channels provided by the distributor, the second column being Web content, and the third being videos and photos from friends and family members. That guide was replicated on laptops, tablets and smartphones.<br /><br />Cisco and Motorola, with a prototype of something it called “MediOS,” want customers to be able to quickly shift a television show or a Web video from one screen to another, and to be able to see what friends are watching at the same time. But that will take deals with distributors — and big investments.<br /><br />As an example, the Google TV setup works well when it is fully tied into a distributors’ system, as it is with Dish Network. “But because there’s no integrated ability to control tuners — to stream content — it’s not standard,” Mr. Chandra told Mr. Genachowski on Friday during a tour of the trade show floor. “It’s going to take years and years and years to negotiate the integrations,” Mr. Chandra added.<br /><br />For content owners, it is a confusing time. At the trade show, companies like News Corporation and the CBS Corporation held court with all manner of manufacturers and in a couple of cases announced new pacts. CBS will soon start allowing users of Boxee, an Internet television software package, to buy episodes of shows like “CSI.”<br /><br />One senior media executive deemed the Internet TV marketplace a “jump ball,” with television makers, distributors and content owners all participating. “That’s why we have to talk to everybody,” said the executive, who insisted on anonymity because those talks are private.<br /><br />What is still lacking, in large part, is consumer education about Internet-connected TVs — but that will change. The Sony chief executive, Howard Stringer, announced Wednesday that Sony would start a worldwide advertising campaign called “Television Redefined” this year.<br /><br />“The next evolution is upon us: the marriage of the television and the Internet,” he said that day, without specifying who would officiate at the wedding.
Eye-Catching Products in a Hall of Gadgetry|6|Jan. 09, 2011|Jenna Wortham, Sam Grobart, & Joshua Brustein|LAS VEGAS — The throngs at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, which ended Sunday, jammed this city’s streets, hotels and cellular networks. At times it seemed it might have been easier to stay at |home and read about it on the Web. But that might have meant missing out on an unexpected discovery or the buzz of something big. Technology editors and reporters of The New York Times who attended share snippets from their notebooks below. Complete coverage of the show is at nytimes.com/gadgetwise.<br /><br />Android Rising<br /><br />Several floors above the rows of slot machines in the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, Matias Duarte sat on a gold velvet couch overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, grinning like the Cheshire Cat.<br /><br />Mr. Duarte, the head designer and interface architect of Android, Google’s mobile operating system, had just helped demonstrate the latest version of the software to an enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />Just a few years ago, industry experts and analysts doubted that Android’s one-size-fits-all approach to software would be successful with phone makers eager to differentiate their devices from one another. But now, many hardware manufacturers are focusing on creating products that run on Android.<br /><br />This year at C.E.S., it seemed impossible to turn around without bumping into a smartphone, tablet or kitchen appliance running a version of Android, which Google gives away free.<br /><br />“It’s the beauty of the open-source model,” said Mr. Duarte. “Anyone and anything can work on it.”<br /><br />The popularity of the Google-powered phones helped the market share of Android phones slip past Apple’s in November, according to the analytics firm comScore.<br /><br />Some industry experts say that may not last, especially as the iPhone becomes available on carriers other than AT&T.<br /><br />“The success of Android hasn’t been put to a test,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. When popular smartphones like the iPhone migrate to other carriers, he said, “we’ll see how it plays out.”<br /><br />But Mr. Duarte was undeterred.<br /><br />“It seemed like a crazy idea when Andy came up with it,” he said, referring to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android. “But this C.E.S is proof that Android is a juggernaut, that it works.” JENNA WORTHAM<br /><br />Hot and Cold<br /><br />Every once in a while at a trade show, you get to see a magic trick. At the booth of a company called Fulton Innovation, there were two.<br /><br />Fulton, based in Ada, Mich., specializes in inductive power systems. The most well-known applications of inductive power are pads that can charge smartphones without wires and cooktops that can heat pots and pans, but otherwise remain cool to the touch.<br /><br />Fulton has taken the inductive concept and run with it. Its booth showcased products with inductive inks in their packaging: when placed on a shelf with an inductive coil, things like cereal boxes and printed labels can light up or flash in patterns.<br /><br />Fulton also has systems intended for homes. Induction cooktops have been around for years, but Fulton has broken down the components and placed them under the countertop, converting any surface into an invisible inductive cooktop that can heat pots and pans.<br /><br />The technology can also heat up packages like soup containers, using the inductive ink. In theory (the technology is real, the commercial partners at this point less so), someone could buy a can of Chef Boyardee, slap it down on an inductive countertop and cook Beefaroni on the spot.<br /><br />The same system can power small appliances. Fulton showed off toasters and blenders retrofitted with inductive-power bases. Place the blender on the surface and it runs as if it were plugged in. The same surface remains otherwise inert and can be treated like any kitchen countertop.<br /><br />C.E.S. was mostly underwhelming this year (3-D TVs, again; tablets, again; Internet-connected TVs, again), but in a small corner of the Las Vegas Convention Center, there was a little slice of Tomorrowland. SAM GROBART<br /><br />Two Touch Screens<br /><br />The tablet is a simple idea: a computer that, from the outside, is little more than a pane of touch-sensitive glass. During a week in which dozens of companies showed variations on this concept, few devices stood out. This was particularly true since many tablets, like the Motorola Xoom, perhaps the one that got the most attention, were not available for full demonstrations.<br /><br />Acer, a company that makes low-cost personal computers, distinguished itself from the crowd on novelty factor alone. It moved perhaps the furthest away from the basic tablet idea with the Iconia. The device, which will run Windows 7, resembles a laptop, but opens up to reveal two 14-inch touch screens. Acer first announced the tablet-laptop hybrid in November and plans to begin selling it in March for under $1,000.<br /><br />The Iconia gives users a large amount of screen space, making for easy multitasking. And the two screens mean that a user can look at one while typing on a virtual keyboard on the other. Some people will see this as an advantage compared with tablets, and others will see it as a disadvantage compared with laptops.<br /><br />There is also a major tradeoff in size. The device is enormous compared with other tablets and weighs more than a notebook.<br /><br />“This is meant to go to the kitchen and the bedroom. It’s not meant to go East to West Coast,” said Ray Sawall, a senior product manager for Acer.<br /><br />Despite its quirks, or perhaps because of them, the Iconia won a contest at C.E.S. called Last Gadget Standing, in which audience members cheered for their favorite from a list of 10 finalists.

Facebook Wins Relatively Few Friends in Japan|7|Jan. 10, 2011|Hiroko Tabuchi|Mr. Zuckerberg, the 26-year-old Facebook chief executive and co-founder, may be the man of the moment in the United States and much of the rest of the online world. But here in Japan, one of the globe’s most wired nations|, few people have heard of him.<br /><br />And relatively few Japanese use Facebook, the global social-networking phenomenon based in Palo Alto, Calif., that recently added its 583 millionth member worldwide.<br /><br />Facebook users in Japan number fewer than two million, or less than 2 percent of the country’s online population. That is in sharp contrast to the United States, where 60 percent of Internet users are on Facebook, according to the analytics site Socialbakers.<br /><br />So even as Goldman Sachs pours $450 million into the company, Japan, with a large and growing online advertising market, is a big hole in Facebook’s global fabric.<br /><br />Japanese, until now, have flocked to various well-entrenched social networking sites and game portals — like Mixi, Gree and Mobage-town. Each has more than 20 million users, and each offers its own approach to connecting people online.<br /><br />One trait those sites have in common is crucial to Japan’s fiercely private Internet users. The Japanese sites let members mask their identities, in distinct contrast to the real-name, oversharing hypothetical user on which Facebook’s business model is based.<br /><br />Japanese Web users, even popular bloggers, typically hide behind pseudonyms or nicknames.<br /><br />“Facebook does face a challenge in Japan,” said Shigenori Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings. “There are powerful rivals, and then there’s the question of Japanese Web culture.”<br /><br />Taro Kodama, Facebook’s manager for Japan, referred questions to the United States, where a spokeswoman, Kumiko Hidaka, did not respond to requests for comment.<br /><br />One key to the growth that might help justify the $50 billion valuation that Goldman’s planned investment placed on Facebook would be to expand its presence in Japan. The overall online advertising market in the country had sales of 706.9 billion yen ($8.5 billion) in 2009. (Someday China could present another big growth opportunity. But, for now, government censors there block access to Facebook.)<br /><br />Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to address the Japan gap. But it will not be easy.<br /><br />To begin with, each of Japan’s own social networking sites, though no longer growing at the breakneck pace of the past few years, has at least 10 times as many users as Facebook, which was introduced in Japanese in mid-2008.<br /><br />Most similar to Facebook is Mixi, started in 2004. Users post photographs, share comments and links, and interact on community pages that have become huge forums based on themes as diverse as recipe-sharing and Michael Jackson. Mixi has more than 21.6 million members.<br /><br />Fast-growing Gree, which overtook Mixi this year with nearly 22.5 million registered users, has expanded by buttressing a popular game platform for mobile phones that offers free games, which users play with manga-style avatars; fancy outfits or tools for games are available for a fee.<br /><br />Mobage-town, which has almost 21.7 million users, offers a similar combination of avatars, games and accessories. It also lets users earn virtual gaming money by clicking on advertisers’ Web sites.<br /><br />Now, all three sites are starting to incorporate elements of Facebook — like allowing third-party developers to make apps for the sites — giving Japanese users little reason to switch.<br /><br />Mixi, meanwhile, has been adapting some techniques of other popular Silicon Valley start-ups. Since late 2009, for example, Mixi users have been able to send short, real-time messages with a maximum of 150 characters, akin to Twitter, the popular microblogging service.<br /><br />Such flourishes have not kept many Japanese consumers from taking to Twitter, which is catching on here at a speed Facebook may envy. A partnership with Digital Garage, a local Internet and mobile services company, has touched off a surge in Twitter users, who numbered about 10 million in Japan in July, according to Nielsen Online NetView. But Twitter does not require users to reveal their identities.<br /><br />Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg are about to get a blast of publicity in Japan, although perhaps not of the most positive sort. “The Social Network,” the movie that presents a less-than-flattering portrayal of Mr. Zuckerberg, opens in Japan this week.<br /><br />Facebook has stepped up efforts to tailor its service to Japan. A Japanese version of the site, translated free by volunteers, was introduced a few years ago, but the company opened a Tokyo office in February to customize the site for Japan. (Facebook’s Japanese site, for example, allows users to display their blood types, considered an important personality trait here.)<br /><br />Some users complain that Facebook’s Japanese-language site is awkward to use.<br /><br />People like Maiko Ueda, 26, a Mixi devotee, see little reason to switch. Ms. Ueda, who works at a stationer based in Osaka, logs into Mixi at least once a day to read other users’ “diaries,” which resemble status updates on Facebook, albeit in longer form. She uploads pictures of her American shorthair cat, and sometimes writes about her day in her own posts.<br /><br />But most people on Mixi do not know her real name, nor have they seen what she looks like. In her five years on Mixi, she has never uploaded a photo of herself.<br /><br />She has heard of Facebook but says she is suspicious of “how open it seems.”<br /><br />“I don’t want to give it my real name,” Ms. Ueda said. “What if strangers find out who you are? Or someone from your company?” She spoke on the condition that her Mixi user name would not be revealed.<br /><br />In a survey of 2,130 Japanese mobile Web users by the Tokyo-based MMD Laboratory, 89 percent of respondents said they were reluctant to disclose their real names on the Web. Specialists say that while Facebook users in the United States tend to recreate real-life social relationships online, many Japanese use Web anonymity to express themselves, free from the pressures to fit into a conformist workplace.<br /><br />In a 2010 survey by Microsoft of social network use among 3,000 people in 11 Asia-Pacific countries and regions, respondents on average said that only about one-quarter of their friends on social networking sites were close friends. In Japan, more than half of all respondents said that not one of their acquaintances on social networks was a close friend.<br /><br />Mixi has grown by letting users sign up with pseudonyms, and gives its subscribers fine-tune controls over who sees posts and other uploads. Mixi also lets users closely monitor who has viewed their profiles with a function known as “footprints.”<br /><br />In contrast, Facebook has insisted that Japanese users adhere to its real-name policy. “Facebook values real-life connections,” warns a message that pops up when a Japanese user withholds information, like the traditional characters used in names. “Please use your real name,” it reads.<br /><br />“I think there has to be an event, a celebrity signing up for Facebook, or something else that teaches Japanese users that identifying themselves online isn’t scary and can be useful,” said Toshihiko Michibata, an e-commerce and social media consultant in Japan.<br /><br />Japan could be an extreme case of the privacy issues that Facebook is tackling elsewhere. Facebook introduced stronger privacy controls in May after groups complained that it shared too much personal data.<br /><br />“The dangers of too little privacy may be lost in the global Facebook fad, but it’s likely to become a growing problem elsewhere,” said a popular blogger known online as Akky Akimoto, who does not reveal his real name and refuses to be photographed in public. “I’d hate it if people on the street recognize me, without me knowing.”<br /><br />Still, Facebook may have a powerful force on its side: Japanese consumers’ penchant for all things new.<br /><br />With Mixi in its seventh year, it is starting “to feel old,” said Mitsuyo Nakata, a Web designer. Its growth has slowed, as have advertising revenue and investor confidence. Profits have fallen at Mixi for three of the last four quarters, and its stock price has slumped 70 percent since its initial public offering in 2006.<br /><br />In an interview with the Nippon Television Network in November, Mr. Kodama, the Facebook manager for Japan, said he was confident that users would start warming to Facebook’s real-name policy once they discovered the usefulness of finding old classmates online.<br /><br />“The Internet in Japan has not been so closely connected with real society,” he said. “Those other community sites can keep offering the joys of staying remote from real life."
