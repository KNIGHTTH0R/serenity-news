Belarus Signals It Could Seize Opponent’s Son|1|Jan. 09, 2011|Michael Schwirtz|MINSK, Belarus — Ever since riot police officers crushed a large protest against apparent fraud in presidential elections here last month, the security services — still called the K.G.B. in this authoritarian former Soviet republic| — have been rounding up people across the country for even the most tangential affiliation with the opposition.<br /><br />Now, it seems, they have gone a step further.<br /><br />The government warned recently that it might seize custody of the 3-year-old son of an opposition presidential candidate who was jailed along with his wife, a journalist. The authorities said that they were investigating the status of the child, who is now living with his grandmother, and that they expected to make a decision by the end of the month.<br /><br />In 16 years as ruler of Belarus, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko has often been called Europe’s last dictator. But the plight of the child, Danil Sannikov, may represent a new tactic in the government’s persecution of the opposition, one that harks back to the Stalin era, when the children of so-called enemies of the people were sent to orphanages after their parents went to the gulag.<br /><br />“Even in my worst nightmares I could not have conceived that this could happen,” said the child’s grandmother, Lyutsina Khalip.<br /><br />Thousands of protesters had filled a large square in central Minsk on the night of Dec. 19, incensed over Mr. Lukashenko’s claim of a sweeping victory in elections that independent observers deemed a farce. The police violently broke up the rally, which had been largely peaceful, arresting more than 600 people.<br /><br />Within 24 hours, seven of the nine opposition candidates for president had been arrested.<br /><br />Danil’s parents, Andrei Sannikov, a leading opposition presidential candidate, and Irina Khalip, a respected investigative journalist, were among those arrested, yanked from their car while Ms. Khalip was giving a telephone interview to a Moscow radio station. Mr. Sannikov was severely beaten and, his lawyer said, his legs were broken.<br /><br />They are among about two dozen people facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of organizing and participating in the protest. Many are being held at the K.G.B. detention center in Minsk, where they have been denied access to lawyers and contact with family.<br /><br />Lyutsina Khalip, the grandmother, said she had not heard from her daughter since the day after her arrest, when she received a letter instructing her to take care of Danil.<br /><br />“She wanted me to tell Danil she really loved him,” Ms. Khalip said, fighting back tears.<br /><br />She said her daughter had received threats about the boy even before the elections. One e-mail from an unknown sender read: “Don’t think about yourself, think about your son.”<br /><br />Ms. Khalip said she first had an inkling that the authorities were turning their attention to Danil shortly after his parents were arrested. She said she was at the K.G.B. detention center trying to deliver a parcel of food and clothes to them when she received an urgent phone call that made her rush to her grandson’s kindergarten.<br /><br />There, she was confronted by two women from the government’s child welfare service. She said the women were friendly, though they delivered an implicit warning:<br /><br />“If you don’t have the financial means or the physical means, don’t worry,” she said they told her. “The child won’t remain alone.”<br /><br />For Ms. Khalip, whose daughter has frequently run afoul of Belarus’s security services over the years, the message was clear.<br /><br />“This is an effort to put pressure on Irina,” she said. “They are capable of squeezing her, and this of course is the most sensitive place.”<br /><br />A representative of the child welfare service could not be reached for comment. Antonina Drugakova, the government social worker overseeing Danil’s case, told the Interfax news agency that the K.G.B. notified her about the boy shortly after his parents’ arrest.<br /><br />“We are required to respond if a child is left without the care of his parents,” Ms. Drugakova said. She said she hoped Danil would be able to remain in the custody of his grandmother, but said the government had a responsibility to determine whether she was fit to care for him.<br /><br />“God forbid that all is not well with the health of the grandmother,” she said.<br /><br />Mr. Sannikov’s lawyer, Pavel Sapelko, said that the K.G.B. notified child welfare services on Dec. 23, six days before his client and Ms. Khalip were officially charged with a crime. He questioned whether it was even legally necessary for Danil’s grandmother to assume legal custody.<br /><br />“The law is there to make sure that a child is not left alone at home or left at kindergarten with no one to pick him up,” Mr. Sapelko said. “If there is no evidence that the child has been abandoned, then there is no reason to dramatize this.”<br /><br />The families of other opposition candidates have also been subject to intimidation. The 22-year-old son of Grigory Kostusyov, one of the candidates arrested, was sentenced to 15 days in jail for trying to hold a solidarity protest a day after the elections. He was released, but was summoned by the K.G.B. again last week for further questioning.<br /><br />“The meeting lasted for about two-and-a-half hours, but thank God he was let go,” said Mr. Kostusyov, who is one of three former candidates to have been freed on the condition that they not leave Belarus. Four others remain in jail.<br /><br />“There has been pressure on my family for my entire political career,” Mr. Kostusyov said.<br /><br />In the weeks since the protest, the K.G.B. has fanned out across the country, interrogating anyone with a history of dissent and jailing those suspected of participating in the protest last month, human rights groups say. The police have been raiding the few independent news outlets and human rights groups that still operate, confiscating computers and documents. Many opposition leaders still at large have fled the country or gone into hiding.<br /><br />Anastasia Loika, who works for the human rights group Vyasna, said there had been lines of people outside the K.G.B. building in Minsk, all of whom had been summoned to be interrogated.<br /><br />“It’s like a conveyer belt,” said Ms. Loika, who was herself questioned for nearly five hours. “Every day there are searches across the country, and every day people are interrogated.”<br /><br />Western leaders have roundly condemned the government’s actions, and the European Union signaled last week that it was ready to impose a travel ban on Mr. Lukashenko.<br /><br />On Saturday, Danil sat playing with a train set in his family’s living room, stuffed animals and action figures piled around him. Since the arrests of his parents, a stream of visitors has brought toys, candy and well wishes to the Sannikov home.<br /><br />Ms. Khalip said the boy did not yet know that his parents had been arrested. She told him they had gone on a business trip, but he seems to sense that something is wrong.<br /><br />“If mama left on a long trip, why didn’t she bring me with her?” Ms. Khalip, 74, said Danil asked her recently. “He cries when I give him a bath because he says, ‘Papa doesn’t wash my hair like that.’ ”<br /><br />Over the past two weeks, Ms. Khalip has completed all of the medical and psychological tests required of her to keep Danil. Even Danil, she said, had to be tested for H.I.V. and syphilis. She said the welfare service should make a decision by the end of the month.
Afghans Strained by Shortages as Iran Tightens Flow of Fuel|2|Jan. 09, 2011|Ray Rivera & Ruhullah Khapalwak|KABUL, Afghanistan — The price of fuel has risen sharply in parts of Afghanistan as an Iranian-imposed slowdown on tanker traffic at key border crossings has stretched into its second month, Afghan off|icials say.<br /><br />The slowdown has increased the price of refined fuel by more than 50 percent in some provinces, forced gas stations on major highways to close and driven up the costs of other basic commodities, including food and heating oil, just as winter is setting in. The bottleneck is also hurting farmers in the south who depend on diesel pumps for irrigation.<br /><br />The issue threatens to strain relations between Afghanistan and Iran, and adds yet another obstacle to President Hamid Karzai and NATO forces as they try to rebuild the economy and provide government services in the face of a resurgent Taliban.<br /><br />It also presents new logistical and security challenges for the government and private fuel brokers as they look to ease the shortage by increasing tanker traffic through northern borders with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. That would require moving the fuel down long, dangerous highways to Afghanistan’s southern provinces, where the fuel crisis and the insurgency have been the most intense.<br /><br />Hundreds of fuel tankers are stranded at the country’s main border crossings with Iran, stopped by Iranian border agents, and the number making it across has slowed to a trickle. About 40 tankers a day are crossing the border at Herat, Farah and Nimruz Provinces, compared with 250 to 330 a day before, according to commerce and customs officials.<br /><br />About 40 percent of Afghanistan’s fuel comes through Iran, on its western border, although most of it does not originate there.<br /><br />Afghan officials say that the Iranian authorities have told them they have been blocking the trucks out of concern that the fuel is being used by NATO military forces in Afghanistan, an assertion that NATO and the Afghan government deny.<br /><br />“The national security team of the Iranian government has decided that coalition and NATO forces are using this fuel for their own use,” Faridullah Sherzai, head of the Afghan Commerce Ministry’s fuel department, said Saturday. “The Iranians want to place some restrictions to ensure these fuels are not used for military forces, but these fuels are not used by NATO forces at all, they are used by civilians in everyday life.”<br /><br />Feda Hussein Maliki, Iran’s ambassador in Kabul, acknowledged that Iran was concerned that fuel was supporting NATO forces, but insisted that it was not blocking the border.<br /><br />“Some media have said that Iran has stopped importing fuel to people of Afghanistan,” he told reporters last week. “This is not true. We do give fuel to people of Afghanistan, and this is included in our plans.”<br /><br />Officials in Tehran referred questions about the issue on Sunday to their Foreign Ministry, which said it was not available for comment.<br /><br />The slowdown began in early December as the Iranian authorities blocked as many as 2,500 fuel tankers from crossing the border, Mr. Sherzai said. Most of the fuel they are carrying is not Iranian, he added, but comes from Turkmenistan and Iraq.<br /><br />After a meeting in Tehran late last month between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and several high-level Afghan officials, including the first vice president, the flow eased somewhat, Mr. Sherzai said. But it remains only a fraction of what it was.<br /><br />At Pul-i-Abrishamin in Nimruz Province, one of the main border crossings with Iran, hundreds of trucks were waiting to cross on Sunday, but officials said they expected only about 15 to make it through by day’s end. The slowdown there has cost the Afghan government tens of thousands of dollars in lost customs fees, said Elhamuddin Mazhar, the chief of the local customs office.<br /><br />The cost of refined fuel, meanwhile, has increased by 53 percent in Nimruz, to $1,500 a ton from $980 a ton, said Hajji Ubidullah Noorzai, head of the Nimruz Chamber of Commerce.<br /><br />He estimated that 80 percent of gas stations in the province had temporarily shut down. “Especially on the highways connecting Nimruz with the rest of the provinces,” he said. “There are only a handful of petrol stations that are selling fuel.”<br /><br />Though the cultivation season is largely over in much of the south, agriculture is taking a hit in the areas where wheat production is still under way.<br /><br />“Yesterday I had four or five farmers come to my office and ask for help,” said Mohammed Akbar Sharifi, head of the Nimruz Province Agriculture Department. “They said they are no longer able to work on their tractors and pump water due to the high fuel prices.”<br /><br />At Islam Qala, the main border crossing in Herat Province, 21 fuel tankers crossed the border on Wednesday and 42 on Thursday, said Khaliqullah, the head of customs there, who goes by one name, as many Afghans do. By midafternoon Saturday, only five had crossed, he said.<br /><br />“On a regular day 100 to 150 cross our border,” he said.<br /><br />Customs officials in Nimruz and Herat say their Iranian counterparts have assured them the issue will be cleared up as early as Tuesday or Wednesday, but Mr. Sherzai said he did not expect a quick resolution. He said the government had begun efforts to increase imports through other borders.<br /><br />Some local agricultural officials worried that if fuel costs remained high, they could drive farmers to cultivate poppies, a more cost-effective crop as opium prices have soared. At the least, higher fuel costs could make it more difficult for NATO and government officials to persuade poppy producers to shift to alternative crops.<br /><br />“If the fuel ban continues by Iran’s government for months, and the fuel price keeps going up and up, there is a possibility the farmers would resort back to poppy,” said Ahmad Shah Roshan, head of the Agriculture Department in Kandahar Province.<br /><br />“Nobody would be able to stop them,” Mr. Sharifi of Nimruz Province, said separately, “since poppy needs less water and makes good money.”<br /><br />Muhammad Aslam, a farmer and landlord in the Maywand District of Kandahar Province, said in a phone interview that fuel prices were a “big deal” for local farmers that could have long-term consequences.<br /><br />“Most of the bore wells are not operating due to the prices of fuel, and farmers are unable to buy fuel,” he said. “There are some people who do have some budget to buy fuel with this current price, but most of the farmers are unable to buy. We want the government to help us in this regard and not to let our trees and farms go dry. The government should have a proper contract to import fuel from other countries.”<br /><br />The price increase has also been felt at the kitchen table.<br /><br />“Buying one jar or bottle of cooking oil used to be 900 Afghanis, but now it has gone up to 1,250 Afghanis,” Mr. Aslam said. “These are the things that we use in our daily life, and living has become more difficult with these high prices. From one side we are worried how we are going to water our farms and from other side we have to feed ourselves.”
Despite Fighting Beforehand, Peaceful Voting in South Sudan|3|Jan. 10, 2011|Jeffrey Gettleman|JUBA, Sudan – As voters continued flooding the polls Monday for a landmark referendum on southern Sudan’s independence, officials said more than 40 people had been killed over the weekend in intense |skirmishes in a contested area along Sudan’s north-south border.<br /><br />The voting, which began on Sunday, is proceeding jubilantly and remarkably smoothly, with high expectations and few serious complaints anywhere across southern Sudan. But if the referendum passes and the south breaks off from the north, the disputed border will become the next issue to resolve, and some fear that the specter of a significant border clash is rising.<br /><br />The Abyei area, where the skirmishes broke out on Friday and Saturday, is considered the most combustible and intractable of all the disputed areas. Both the north and the south claim historic ties to it and are refusing to budge. Some Western analysts have called Abyei “Sudan’s Jerusalem.”<br /><br />Most people here in Juba, the southern capital, were unaware of the rising tensions along the border, which is several hundred miles away. Voters continued to pour into polling places on Monday, to dance and whistle and sing, and to talk excitedly about how secession will bring new bridges, new roads, new schools, new hospitals, new jobs, even new food.<br /><br />“You’ll be able to eat what you want and do what you want,” said Daniel Bior Garang, who voted for secession.<br /><br />Thabo Mbeki, South Africa’s former president who is in Sudan observing the election, said the sky-high hopes reminded him of the heady days of the 1960’s when so many Africans broke free from their colonial masters.<br /><br />“The great excitement of liberation comes with high expectations,” he said. The trick, he added, will be meeting them.<br /><br />The biggest challenge southern Sudan will face, he said, is avoiding the same pitfall that plunged Sudan into civil war decades ago: unequal development.<br /><br />Though the north-south civil war has often been simplified as a battle between the Christian and animist south versus Arab rulers in the north, the south itself is very diverse, home to scores of ethnic groups and dozens of languages, Christians, animists and Muslims, traditional people whose lives revolve around cows and more modern folk who worship cash.<br /><br />“They have to manage this diversity carefully, giving all the groups a sense of belonging,” said Mr. Mbeki, who has been the lead mediator between the north and the south on separation issues. “If not, you will get the same fractures that took place in the whole of Sudan in south Sudan.”<br /><br />Around Abyei, those fractures have already become violent. According to elders of the nomadic Misseriya community, who roam across the Abyei area and are aligned to the northern Sudanese government in Khartoum, southern soldiers shelled their camps, slaughtered their cattle and killed more than 10 civilians over the weekend.<br /><br />“I just buried thirteen of my people,” said Sadig Babo Nimir, a Misseriya leader who spoke by telephone from Khartoum.<br /><br />In retaliation, the Misseriya attacked southern Sudanese security forces, killing several of them and capturing their gun trucks and weapons, Mr. Sadig said. “As Misseriya, we don’t want anything but peace,” he added. “We are just defending ourselves.”<br /><br />Southern officials tell a different story. Philip Aguer, spokesman for the southern military, said the Misseriya attacked police officers first and the nomads “are not moving with cattle, they are moving with machine guns.” He said the Misseriya had been armed by the Khartoum government to “disrupt the referendum. ‘’<br /><br />Despite fears of mounting tensions, Southern Sudan may surprise its doubters. In a way, it already has. After all the doomsday talk and fretting about whether the south was even capable of holding the referendum, or whether it would be delayed or chaotic, voting seems to be going well. Thousands of people lined up once again before dawn on Monday, though the crowds in Juba were not nearly as large as on Sunday.<br /><br />This is a country where more than three quarters of adults can not read, but at the polling places, there is a methodical system for checking voters’ identification cards, handing out ballots, creasing them down the middle and tucking them into a plastic tub. It is slow-going — up to seven minutes per voter in some places, which means the last person in line can wait all day, often under an unforgiving sun. But “better than expected” seems to be the mantra among foreign election observers.<br /><br />“I’m pretty impressed, actually,” said J. Scott Gration, President Obama’s special envoy to Sudan, also in town to observe the voting. “If things go the way they are going,” he said, “I see no reason why we shouldn’t be able to have a referendum where the outcome is credible.”<br /><br />That outcome will most likely be an overwhelmingly vote for secession, which means Sudan will then begin the delicate process of splitting in two and a new, poor, landlocked and very hopeful nation will soon be born.<br /><br />“Yeah, I’ve heard this a lot, ‘I’m voting to be free and then all my problems will be over,’” laughed Valentino Achak Deng, whose nightmarish experience as a refugee was the subject of the best-selling book “What Is the What?”<br /><br />“The government will have a lot to face,” he said. After the referendum passes and independence is declared in July, as predicted, “There will be a lot of complaining. I wouldn’t rule out demonstrations. People don’t understand how young nations start and what it means to build a country from scratch.”<br /><br />It is not only the southern Sudanese who are excited by all this. Other separatist regions in Africa, and there are many of them – the Ogaden in Ethiopia; the Western Sahara; the Cabinda enclave in Angola and the breakaway region of Somaliland, to name a few – may be encouraged to push harder for independence now that the African Union and Western powers have made an exception to their longstanding distaste for redrawing borders.<br /><br />Western diplomats say Somaliland probably has the strongest case to be recognized as an independent nation, because it is the only democratic part of Somalia and is an oasis of stability in the war-ravaged country. This summer, Somaliland held a legitimate election in which the incumbent president lost and gracefully handed over power to the opposition, a rarity considering the disputed elections in Ivory Coast, Kenya, Zimbabwe and elsewhere).<br /><br />Like southern Sudan, Somaliland defines its borders by colonial documents that recognized it as a distinct entity. There are even Somaliland representatives in Juba right now, trying to buttonhole Western and African dignitaries and plead that Somaliland be recognized as the next independent African state.<br /><br />“I’m encouraged,” said Abdillahi M. Duale, a former Somaliland government minister, who met with Mr. Mbeki in Juba this past week. “What’s happening here in south Sudan is going to help us.”
Iran Claims to Have Broken Israeli Spy Ring|4|Jan. 10, 2011|William Yong & Alan Cowell|TEHRAN —Iran’s Intelligence Ministry said Monday that it had broken up an international Israeli spy network linked to the assassination of an Iranian nuclear theorist a year ago, state-owned media said|.<br /><br />After a broad investigation, Iran succeeded in arresting “the main agents behind the terrorist incident” and dismantling a network “of Israeli spies and terrorists,” the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted a ministry statement as saying, according to Press TV,. Iran’s state-run English-language satellite broadcaster.<br /><br />Israel does not routinely comment on such assertions and there was no immediate response from the Israeli authorities on Monday.<br /><br />In November, Iran blamed Israel as well as the United States after assailants on motorcycles launched separate bomb attacks against two other top Iranian nuclear scientists in Tehran, killing one and wounding the other.<br /><br />On Monday, the ministry’s statement said that Israeli intelligence service Mossad “had used bases in certain European and non-European countries as well as Iran’s neighboring states in an attempt to achieve its inhuman and non-Islamic goals.”<br /><br />Those bases, the statement said, had been “used in the assassination of Dr. Masoud Ali Mohammadi,” the theorist, who taught physics at the University of Tehran. He was killed in January of last year by a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in northern Tehran. I.<br /><br />The scientist killed in November was Majid Shahriari, who the Iranian authorities said managed a “major” nuclear project. His wounded colleague, Fereydoon Abbasi, may have been even more important; he was on the United Nations Security Council’s sanctions list for ties to the Iranian nuclear effort.<br /><br />The ministry statement said its invesitation had involved “months of complicated measures and access to sources of the Israeli regime,” and inflicted “heavy damage on Israel’s information and security structures, ” discovering “very important and sensitive” information about Mossad teams.<br /><br />Iran’s nuclear program is the focus of profound disputes between Tehran, which says it wants to develop its nuclear capability for peaceful purposes, and other countries, including the United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran is seeking to build a nuclear bomb.<br /><br />Iran has frequently assailed Israel — its regional arch-foe — for seeking to disrupt its program. For its part, Israel has not ruled out military action against Iran’s nuclear sites if there is no diplomatic resolution.<br /><br />Talks about the program are set to resume in Istanbul this month between Iran and six countries negotiating the nuclear issue — the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — along with the European Union.
U.S. Says Sanctions Hurt Iran Nuclear Program|5|Jan. 10, 2011|Mark Landler|ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s ability to produce a nuclear weapon has been delayed by sanctions, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said here on Monday, the strongest claim yet by the Obama administration| that its pressure campaign is hampering Iran’s nuclear ambitions.<br /><br />“Iran has had technological problems that have made it slow down its timetable,” Mrs. Clinton said a televised town-hall meeting at a university in this Persian Gulf emirate. “The sanctions are working,” she added. “Their program, from our best estimate, has been slowed down.”<br /><br />Her blunt statement, which comes after similar comments by Israeli and European officials, is sure to color the debate in the Middle East. Iran’s neighbors have watched its drive for nuclear status with increasing alarm, with some pressing the United States to act against Tehran soon.<br /><br />Mrs. Clinton did not detail the problems with Iran’s program, how long a delay they might cause, or the precise sources of her information. But she argued that the difference between a one-year development cycle and a three- or four-year cycle does not alter the strategic choices that confront Iran’s neighbors or the rest of the world.<br /><br />Speaking to students on the first day of a four-day visit to the region, Mrs. Clinton urged Arab states not to waver in enforcing sanctions. Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where she traveled later on Monday, have curtailed their banking relationships with Iran, under pressure from the United States.<br /><br />“If Iran gets a nuclear weapon,” Mrs. Clinton said, “won’t you believe you have to have a nuclear weapon too?”<br /><br />Raising the prospect of a calamitous nuclear arms race in the Middle East, she said, “It’s first and foremost in the interests of the region to persuade Iran not to pursue nuclear weapons.”<br /><br />Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear development program is for peaceful civilian purposes.<br /><br />Last week, the departing director of Israel’s intelligence service, Meir Dagan, said he believed Iran would not be able to make a bomb until 2015, at the earliest, “because of measures that have been deployed against them.”<br /><br />There is evidence of computer sabotage from an unknown source that has caused glitches in the functioning of the centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium. American officials have also said that Iran is having trouble obtaining materials like carbon fiber to build the centrifuges.<br /><br />The administration says the sanctions are squeezing Iran’s leaders in other ways, depriving them of access to financial markets and turning the Iranian state shipping line into a pariah in foreign ports.<br /><br />Although Mrs. Clinton’s remarks were the most public statement of the effect of sanctions on Iran’s program, in written testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee last December, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, William J. Burns, said, “Sanctions have hindered Iran’s development of a nuclear capability and the means to deliver them.”<br /><br />Mrs. Clinton’s trip has other elements – including a stop Monday at a solar-energy research facility – but her meetings have been dominated by what to do about Iran. The fear of Gulf leaders about a nuclear Iran was palpable in the diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group.<br /><br />Mrs. Clinton said the success of the sanctions may have bought the international community some additional breathing room. But she seemed determined to avoid complacency. “We have time, but not a lot of time,” she said to three female hosts of a program called “Sweet Talk.”<br /><br />Aside from a soft-ball question about how Mrs. Clinton met her husband at law school, there was little sweet talk on the program, much of which revolved around the threat from Iran and the administration’s fruitless efforts to broker a peace agreement in the Middle East.<br /><br />Mrs. Clinton continually linked the two issues, accusing Iran of stoking the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as a way of deflecting attention from its nuclear activities.<br /><br />“If they can shift attention away from their own internal decisions about whether or not to pursue nuclear weapons, they will be very happy about that,” she said, adding, “We cannot let that attention get diverted.”<br /><br />Despite the recent setbacks, she said the United States remained committed to a two-state solution. Direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians fell apart late last year because of a deadlock over the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.<br /><br />On Sunday, tensions were inflamed further when Israel began bulldozing the Shepherd’s Hotel, a decaying, but symbolic building in East Jerusalem once owned by Palestinians, to make way for new Jewish apartments. She said in a statement that the demolition “contradicts the logic of a reasonable and necessary agreement between the parties on the status of Jerusalem.”<br /><br />Speaking here, she said, “It is hard for both the Palestinians and the Israelis to have enough trust and confidence in the other to take the risks for peace. Part of what I am trying to do is to build up outside support for these tough decisions.”
