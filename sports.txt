Packers’ Pressure Neutralizes Vick|1|Jan. 09, 2011|Jere Longman|PHILADELPHIA — Despite the exhilarating play of Michael Vick in a redemptive season, the Eagles were left Sunday with a 21-16 playoff defeat to Green Bay and one extremely inconvenient fact: even| though quarterback Donovan McNabb was traded to Washington, his designated replacement Kevin Kolb was benched after a concussion and Vick was put into the lineup with often stunning results, Philadelphia won one fewer game this season than last.<br /><br />Again, the Eagles (10-7) exited in the wild-card round of the playoffs, left with as many questions as answers, including what to do with Vick, whose contract expires, and Kolb, who lost another year of development.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the patient and mobile Aaron Rodgers won his first playoff game as Green Bay’s quarterback. He completed 18 of 27 passes for 180 yards and 3 touchdown passes against a porous Eagles defense that surrendered 34 touchdowns through the air this season.<br /><br />Green Bay (11-6) will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a divisional matchup, encouraged that the emergent running back James Starks set a Packers rookie playoff rushing record with 123 yards on 23 carries.<br /><br />Vick’s future remains uncertain. The Eagles could place a franchise tag on him, sign him to a long-term contract or simply let him go, which seems highly unlikely.<br /><br />“I hope so,” Vick said of returning to Philadelphia, “but in this business, you never know. I’m going to stay optimistic and keep believing. I feel I can play at a high level for the next couple of years.”<br /><br />Philadelphia’s season changed greatly in its opener last September, when Green Bay linebacker Clay Matthews pummeled Kolb, leaving him with a concussion and returning him to a backup role behind the revived Vick.<br /><br />Public reaction to Vick’s ascendancy was mixed. He had spent 18 months in prison for operating a dogfighting ring. But as a football player this season, he was thinner, faster, more adept as a passer than he had ever been, and familiarly threatening on the run. He became a candidate for the league’s most valuable player.<br /><br />His slight frame took a repeated pounding, though, and defenses grew more forceful with blitzes late in the season. Vick’s passing became less accurate, and he sometimes seemed too eager to take off running. He sustained a thigh contusion two weeks ago and limped at times on Sunday.<br /><br />Vick was sacked three times and flushed from the pocket repeatedly as he completed 20 of 36 passes for 292 yards and a touchdown. With 33 seconds remaining, he threw a poor pass into the end zone that was intercepted, killing a potential winning drive for the Eagles.<br /><br />Still, the defeat could hardly be pinned on Vick, who brought hope and excitement to a season that was considered beforehand to be a rebuilding one in Philadelphia.<br /><br />On Sunday, Green Bay was miserly on its scoring drives, keeping Vick off the field for long stretches. Rodgers put the Packers ahead, 14-0, on a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tom Crabtree late in the first quarter and a 9-yarder to receiver James Jones with 5 minutes 21 seconds remaining in the first half.<br /><br />David Akers, the usually reliable Eagles kicker, missed field-goal attempts of 41 and 34 yards on a windy day. Philadelphia’s defense was porous and depleted by injury; its makeshift offensive line was erratic. Right tackle Winston Justice struggled at times against the blitzing Matthews. He committed two infractions on the same play in the third quarter and was eventually benched.<br /><br />With 7:33 left in the third quarter, Green Bay took a 21-10 lead on a 16-yard screen pass from Rodgers to running back Brandon Jackson. Still, Vick and the Eagles were resilient. He sneaked into the end zone from the 1 with 4:02 remaining in the game, drawing the Eagles to 21-16.<br /><br />Philadelphia’s 2-point-conversion attempt failed when tight end Brent Celek stepped out of bounds on his route, making him ineligible for the catch he made in the corner of the zone.<br /><br />The resulting penalty gave Philadelphia a do-over, but Vick planted sharply, trying to avoid Green Bay’s blitzing linebacker A. J. Hawk, and wrenched an ankle.<br /><br />He limped off the field.<br /><br />There were reports, unconfirmed, that a Philadelphia trainer tried to take Vick’s helmet away because of the injury. Vick said only, “Nothing was going to stop me from going back out.”<br /><br />With 1:45 remaining after a punt, Philadelphia began a final drive from its 34. Vick was confident.<br /><br />“I had an upbeat feeling about myself,” he said. “I felt like I was in control.”<br /><br />He passed to DeSean Jackson for 28 yards, then to Riley Cooper for 11 more. Quickly, the Eagles were at the Green Bay 27. On first down, Vick threw to the left side of the end zone for Cooper, but his pass was underthrown and intercepted by cornerback Tramon Williams with 33 seconds left.<br /><br />“I got greedy,” Vick said, explaining that he should have dumped the ball to a running back. “It’s a bad way to go out, but, hey, I went down swinging.”<br /><br />He unsnapped his chin strap in disappointment, a comeback and an expectant season having come up short of his Super Bowl dream.<br /><br />“This one hurt more” than any previous ending, Vick said. “I expected so much out of myself. It was a great season, but that’s not enough.”
Reed Pushes Grief Aside and Provides Stability for Ravens|2|Jan. 09, 2011|Karen Crouse|KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Chiefs were ahead of the visiting Baltimore Ravens in the second quarter of their A.F.C. wild-card game Sunday, and the Arrowhead Stadium crowd was in a frenzy. The 72,190 fans could smell an upset brewing|. Then Ravens safety Ed Reed sniffed out a third-down pass and rose to meet the receiver, Dexter McCluster, and tackled him 4 yards short of the first-down marker.<br /><br />It was the kind of play that is all in a day’s work for Reed, who was playing under circumstances that were anything but normal. Ravens Coach John Harbaugh looked back on Reed’s second-quarter stop as the turning point in the Ravens’ 30-7 defeat of the Chiefs.<br /><br />“It was our rallying point,” Harbaugh said. “He turned this thing around.”<br /><br />The Ravens scored 27 unanswered points after that, beginning with their ensuing drive, which covered 80 yards and was capped off by a 9-yard pass to Ray Rice from Joe Flacco. The Ravens’ defense held the Chiefs to 25 net yards in the second half. Dwayne Bowe, the Kansas City receiver who had 15 touchdowns during the regular season, did not have a catch.<br /><br />The Ravens, who have won five consecutive games, play at Pittsburgh in the second round, while the Chiefs (10-7) will have to wait at least another year to notch their first playoff victory since 1994.<br /><br />Flacco, one of only five quarterbacks in N.F.L. history to start a postseason game in each of his first three seasons, was sacked four times but the Chiefs could not keep him down.<br /><br />He bounced back after every tackle and rebounded from a first-quarter fumble to throw for 265 yards and 2 scores. Aside from the reception to Rice, Flacco completed a 4-yarder to Anquan Boldin after a third-quarter interception thrown by the Chiefs’ Matt Cassel, who was as green as Flacco is not.<br /><br />Cassel, in his first postseason start since his senior year at Chatsworth (Calif.) High School in 1999, threw three second-half interceptions and finished 9 of 18 for 70 yards. After completing four of his first five passes, with the lone incompletion a catch out of bounds by tight end Tony Moeaki, Cassel misfired on 8 of his 13 passes as the offense derailed in the second half.<br /><br />“I don’t feel like they are such a superior team to us that we didn’t have an opportunity in this game,” Cassel said. “We got into the second half and it was just a lot of bad football on our part.”<br /><br />The Ravens’ defense had something to do with that. It drew inspiration from Reed, the Pro Bowl safety who chose to play despite the disappearance two days earlier of his 28-year-old brother, Brian.<br /><br />Reed’s family believes Brian jumped into the Mississippi River while running from the police. He has not turned up, although his shoes and jacket were found.<br /><br />“Ed and the Reed family, they’re going through a lot right now,” Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs said. “We wanted to give him three hours of peace, just go out there and have fun with your football brothers.”<br /><br />Harbaugh was not sure what to expect from Reed, who had a league-high eight interceptions in 10 games after sitting out the first six because of hip surgery. Reed was also playing with bruised ribs.<br /><br />“It crossed my mind that he might not play,” Harbaugh said. “But I kind of figured he would because he’s Ed Reed and he’s always there for his teammates. There was nothing he could do for his family down there but there was something he could do here for his football family.”<br /><br />In the first quarter, Reed was among the would-be tacklers the Chiefs’ second-year running back Jamaal Charles shrugged off on a 41-yard scoring burst. Charles averaged 6.38 yards a carry during the regular season and had 87 yards on seven carries in the first half.<br /><br />He went backward in the second half, finishing the game with 82 yards on 9 carries.<br /><br />As he went, so went the Chiefs. “It was difficult at that point, when things started to unravel,” Cassel said, adding, “It was one bad thing after another.”<br /><br />The Ravens’ defense was led by Suggs, who had four unassisted tackles and two sacks; the linebacker Jameel McClain, who recorded a team-high six tackles and linebacker Ray Lewis, who finished with four tackles and a sack for a 10-yard loss.<br /><br />Then there was Reed, whose four tackles did not begin to sum up his contribution. His poise under circumstances unfathomable to his teammates faltered only once all day. He broke down when presented with a game ball.<br /><br />Asked if it was tough to play under the circumstances, Reed laughed ruefully and said: “Not really, man. This is a child’s game we’re playing and that’s it.” He added: “It’s my job. I know at the end of the day it’s all going to work out according to God’s plan.”<br /><br />His tackle of McCluster, he said, came on a play that did not go as planned.<br /><br />“There was a miscommunication,” Reed said, adding, “To get that guy on the ground was huge. I just thank God I was right there to make the tackle.”<br /><br />As he spoke, Reed turned the game ball around in his hands as if it were a crystal ball. There is no telling the future, but for a few hours on Sunday, Reed was able to lose himself in the moment and extend the Ravens’ season another week.
Political Heavy Hitters Take On College Bowls|3|Jan. 09, 2011|Katie Thomas|College football’s bowl system has long been a target of sports fans, newspaper columnists and even President Obama. But now a different kind of group is weighing in on the way the sport’s champion is determined: a Washington political| action committee.<br /><br />The lawyers behind the committee, Playoff PAC, seek a playoff system in college football more akin to the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament.<br /><br />They are not just producing attack ads; they are also going after the bowls’ finances. In complaints to the Internal Revenue Service, they have raised questions involving three of the four bowls that make up the five-game Bowl Championship Series about interest-free loans, high salaries, lobbying payments and lavish perks for some bowl executives. They have also made accusations about illegal campaign contributions.<br /><br />Most recently, Playoff PAC described to the I.R.S. an all-expenses-paid Caribbean cruise that the Orange Bowl hosted for 40 athletic directors and conference commissioners, and their spouses, although it appears no business meetings were scheduled during the trip.<br /><br />“They are using these tax-exempt entities as their own private fiefdoms,” said Matthew Sanderson, a founder of Playoff PAC.<br /><br />The committee, which was founded in 2009, has emerged as one of the few organized voices opposing the college bowl system, which culminates Monday night with the Bowl Championship Series title game between Auburn and Oregon in Glendale, Ariz. Critics say the B.C.S. is unfair to teams from outside the six most powerful and wealthiest conferences, whose champions are guaranteed a berth in the series, and they disagree with the national championship being determined by a complicated set of polls and computer rankings rather than on the field.<br /><br />Four of Playoff PAC’s founding members, including Mr. Sanderson, are alumni of the University of Utah, whose football team was undefeated in 2008 and, though it received a berth in a B.C.S. bowl, was shut out of the national championship game because it did not play in one of the six major conferences.<br /><br />But this is no ordinary group of adversaries who are donating their free time and political skills to keep bowl executives on their toes. Mr. Sanderson, a campaign finance lawyer for Republican candidates, and other members have recruited prominent Washington names to aid their cause. Marcus S. Owens, a former director of the I.R.S. division that oversees nonprofit groups, volunteered to advise on the I.R.S. complaint, as did Joseph M. Birkenstock, a former chief counsel for the Democratic National Committee.<br /><br />Others who have donated time or money include Danny Diaz, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee, and a former Federal Election Commission chairman, Scott E. Thomas, a Democrat.<br /><br />“Nobody had taken a hard look at exactly what the B.C.S. does,” said Mr. Birkenstock, who supervises Mr. Sanderson at the Washington law firm Caplin & Drysdale, which also employs Mr. Owens. “Nobody had used the tools that we had used in a political environment,” he added.<br /><br />Around the same time that Playoff PAC went public in the fall of 2009, the B.C.S. sharpened its public relations message, starting Facebook and Twitter accounts and hiring a political veteran of its own, the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, as a consultant. B.C.S. officials said the changes were planned before Playoff PAC was founded.<br /><br />In the case of the nonprofit organization that runs the Fiesta Bowl, which is hosting the national championship game, the I.R.S. complaint highlighted evidence of potentially illegal campaign contributions. The complaint also presented evidence that Fiesta Bowl officials had failed to disclose on federal tax returns that they had engaged in lobbying.<br /><br />Fiesta Bowl officials have acknowledged that the Arizona attorney general’s office has begun an investigation and that the bowl’s board has named a special committee to look into the allegations related to the campaign contributions. The Arizona Republic reported in December 2009 that bowl employees were being reimbursed for donations to political candidates.<br /><br />Nonprofit organizations like those that operate the bowls are banned from donating to political campaigns and they must declare any lobbying payments on federal tax returns. Excessive salaries or perks could be seen as using charitable funds to enrich private individuals. If the I.R.S. finds wrongdoing, the bowls can be fined or have their nonprofit status revoked. A spokeswoman for the I.R.S. declined to comment, saying that the agency does not comment on taxpayer information.<br /><br />Bowl officials and their supporters dismiss the PAC as an assortment of disgruntled fans who have barely registered on their radar, having raised less than $10,000 in its 16-month existence.<br /><br />“I don’t think they’re on our minds most of the time,” said Andrew Bagnato, a spokesman for the Fiesta Bowl. “They have obviously garnered a lot of attention for their cause, but sometimes it’s difficult to tell exactly who they represent. What is their constituency?”<br /><br />He declined to comment on the Arizona inquiry but said that the Fiesta Bowl was in compliance with federal tax laws. Spokesmen for the Orange and Sugar Bowls said their bowls were also in compliance.<br /><br />The details uncovered in the complaints raise issues that go deeper than whether the current system is fair to competitors, said Mr. Owens, who said he did not follow college football. “The facts are pretty compelling that there is something going on there that is not charitable and educational, and it varies from bowl game to bowl game,” he said.<br /><br />The Orange Bowl Committee released a statement in response to the I.R.S. complaint about the cruise, saying it “believes it is important to meet with its key stakeholders to communicate and advocate our business focus.”<br /><br />Bill Hancock, the executive director of the B.C.S., questioned Playoff PAC’s aggressive style. Mr. Hancock has been the target of a handful of advertisements the PAC placed on YouTube, including one that compared him to Saddam Hussein’s spokesman during the Iraq war.<br /><br />“I don’t think those kind of tactics belong in college football,” he said. “All of us taxpayers are forced to deal with those tactics every two years at election time, and I find them distasteful.”<br /><br />Mr. Sanderson acknowledged that the group had not raised much money, and said it was set up as a political action committee to ensure flexibility to support candidates who favor a college football playoff. The group has produced some advertisements that Mr. Sanderson said received limited airtime, but he said their priority was completing projects like the I.R.S. complaint. “We don’t need a lot of money because we’re able to attract professional help,” he said.<br /><br />Some say the group has succeeded, on a shoestring budget, in crystallizing what they describe as widespread fan frustration with the current system.<br /><br />“It’s one thing for a journalist to write a story, or even write a book, but it’s not our life’s work — you move on,” said Dan Wetzel, a Yahoo Sports columnist whose book, “Death to the B.C.S.: The Definitive Case Against the Bowl Championship Series,” was published last year. “These guys don’t move on.”<br /><br />The members of Playoff PAC are not the first in Washington to take up the cause. As president-elect, Mr. Obama promised to “throw my weight around” to bring about a college football playoff. And two Republicans — Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Representative Joe Barton of Texas — held hearings on the issue in 2009. Mr. Hatch also called on the Justice Department to conduct an antitrust investigation of the B.C.S. Attorney General Mark Shurtleff of Utah is investigating allegations of antitrust violations by the B.C.S. and is recruiting his counterparts from other states to the cause.<br /><br />Last year, the University of Utah announced it would join the Pacific-10, one of the conferences that receives a guaranteed spot in the Bowl Championship Series.<br /><br />Utah’s change in fortune does not weaken Mr. Sanderson’s resolve. “We’re starting to see real momentum,” he said. “It may take some time for these factors to play out, but I think we started something in motion that will have a lasting effect on the post-season in football.”
Auburn’s Newton May Leave a Legacy in Scrutiny|4|Jan. 09, 2011|Pete Thamel|PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — The specter of the N.C.A.A.’s investigation into the recruitment of Auburn quarterback Cam Newton has largely been absent from the buildup to Monday night’s national championship| game.<br /><br />But if No. 1 Auburn defeats No. 2 Oregon to give the Southeastern Conference its fifth consecutive Bowl Championship Series title, there will inevitably be an awkward wait to see if Newton’s eligibility — and the national title — holds up.<br /><br />Given the time that lapsed between Newton’s signing with Auburn on Dec. 31, 2009, and the start of the N.C.A.A.’s investigation months later, it appears unlikely that Auburn would be stripped of its title. (The N.C.A.A. and Auburn have established that Newton’s father, Cecil, shopped him to Mississippi State without his knowledge. Auburn has not been implicated in any wrongdoing.)<br /><br />“Based on established facts and anything that I personally know, I don’t know of any issue,” Mike Slive, the SEC commissioner, said. “Again, I’m not out looking. That’s not my job. That’s a question for the N.C.A.A. But I haven’t been told of anything.”<br /><br />The N.C.A.A. does not comment on developing investigations. But it has been discussing with the SEC and other conference leaders a change in procedure that would make more uniform the process of informing the N.C.A.A. of potential violations. In theory, that could help avoid messy situations like Newton’s, in which months passed without significant action.<br /><br />Julie Roe Lach, the N.C.A.A.’s new vice president for enforcement, met with Slive and the SEC associate commissioner Greg Sankey last month in Birmingham, Ala., to discuss, among other things, the SEC’s process of handling potential violations. Roe Lach stressed that the meeting was scheduled before the Newton investigation. She said that in talking to the SEC and other conference officials, she found disparities in when leagues reported potential violations to the N.C.A.A.<br /><br />“I recognize people are doing it differently, and we need to examine whether we try to make it more equitable across the board,” Roe Lach said.<br /><br />Interviews with officials in all six major conferences revealed a perception of criticism over the SEC’s handling of cases. The league’s reputation is that it considers allegations more like a defense lawyer than a prosecutor. Roe Lach is familiar with that notion and said she disagreed with it.<br /><br />Slive and Sankey fervently dispute it, and agreed that the impetus could be the SEC’s being on the verge of its fifth straight national title. But fair or not, the criticism of the SEC’s so-called defense lawyer mentality exists.<br /><br />“I’ve heard that criticism,” said Kevin Weiberg, the Pacific-10 Conference’s deputy commissioner, who is a former commissioner of the Big 12. “It’s not something I’ve personally witnessed. I’ve not heard enough about their process to pass judgment, but I’ve certainly heard that.”<br /><br />One of the tensions with the SEC’s reporting process is the 30 days institutions are given to self-investigate allegations before they are sent back to the SEC and later forwarded to the N.C.A.A. Sankey said that the time period was not hard and fast, and that the league had forwarded information directly to the N.C.A.A. upon receiving it in the past. He insisted that many universities in the conference would swear the SEC’s compliance office worked in a prosecutorial role.<br /><br />“We have pursued aggressively information from schools and gone back three or four times,” Sankey said. “It doesn’t always fit into a nice 30-day package.”<br /><br />The issue has been amplified by the Newton situation; the first call to the SEC’s office about Newton’s father’s shopping him to Mississippi State came in January 2010. The SEC wanted more specific information, but that did not arrive until July because of a heavy workload in Mississippi State’s compliance department.<br /><br />When asked if the SEC alerted Auburn before taking the information to the N.C.A.A., Slive said, “We followed our process.”<br /><br />Slive publicly chided Mississippi State for not providing follow-up information in a timely manner. Mississippi State defended the way it handled the process, saying in a statement that it did not have any specific incriminating information about another program. It just wanted to inform the SEC of the offer that had been made on behalf of Newton’s camp.<br /><br />Sankey said: “This is not a circumstance that we want to see repeated, ever, in any way. There are lessons learned, and things will be done differently in the future.”<br /><br />Speaking generally, Roe Lach said one reason for more uniform rules was that the N.C.A.A. needed “to be involved from the get-go.”<br /><br />She added: “I think we need to be alerted very early on. That’s really part of what’s driving the need for us to establish some guidelines.”<br /><br />Officials in other leagues said a situation similar to Newton’s would have been handled much differently. Sankey cautioned against comparisons, saying it was unfair to comment without knowing exactly what occurred and what information was known when.<br /><br />Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, not speaking specifically about the Newton situation, said, “If I had detailed information that one of our schools had made a very significant proposal to a player or someone had sought a significant amount of money, I would bring it to the N.C.A.A.”<br /><br />Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe, who along with Delany is a former N.C.A.A. investigator, agreed generally with Delany’s assessment.<br /><br />“I’ve told my membership, if I get a report of a possible violation by them or an outside institution, I would go right to the N.C.A.A.,” Beebe said. “That’s one where I would seek the counsel of the N.C.A.A. for that by calling Julie or one of the directors.”<br /><br />The SEC has been hypersensitive to criticism in the Newton case. Sankey said that the intensity of football in the South and the popularity of recruiting coverage led him to explore issues on “a regular basis.” He said the SEC’s process being singled out was not fair.<br /><br />“For all of us, matters erupt from time to time that cause us to forget we all deal with these types of challenges,” he said. “I think folks react in a way that can be critical without remembering that they do face those same challenges.”<br /><br />All the conference officials generally agreed that they would be open to a national dialogue on a more uniform process of handling potential violations. The Atlantic Coast Conference associate commissioner Shane Lyons warned that the “devil is in the details” when it came to devising a plan. But everyone appeared open to discussion.<br /><br />“One of the tenets of the N.C.A.A. over the years has been trying to establish a system to put everyone on an even playing field,” said Joe D’Antonio, the Big East associate commissioner for compliance. “If they find something in terms of enforcement, I don’t see how that would be a bad thing.”<br /><br />Slive said he was open to dialogue.<br /><br />“If our process is troublesome to the N.C.A.A.,” he said, “we are prepared to adjust and amend and participate in the national dialogue.”<br /><br />Long after Auburn plays for the B.C.S. title on Monday, Cam Newton’s legacy appears as if it will live on far from the playing field.
Rushing Games Rise for the Playoffs|5|Jan. 10, 2011|Judy Battista|The N.F.L. set a record for passing touchdowns a week ago, with 751 this season, smashing the former mark by 19. That should not come as a surprise: the league is flush with outstanding quarterbacks|, particularly ones schooled in the pass-intensive spread college offenses that have made their transition to the N.F.L. much easier.<br /><br />“I still hear people say, ‘We’ve got to run the ball,’ ” Troy Aikman, the Hall of Fame quarterback and Fox analyst, said of the trend. “I don’t know when that cliché is going to die.”<br /><br />Not in this postseason. The wild-card weekend proved one thing: there’s still a lot of 3-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust lurking in the hearts of football coaches. And teams that can run the ball and stop the run still have the best chance to advance. None of the four winning teams rushed for fewer than 138 yards this weekend (the Jets had 169 yards, the best of the four winners), and only one of the losing teams, the Kansas City Chiefs, topped 100 yards.<br /><br />The snapshot from the weekend was Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch’s electrifying 67-yard touchdown run in which he broke numerous tackles and straight-armed Tracy Porter into Puget Sound. How out of left field was that run? The Seahawks ranked 31st in rushing this season. But for old-school football, it would be hard to top the times when the Packers had two fullbacks — there are teams that do not even have one true fullback on the roster — and a running back, James Starks, on the field at the same time.<br /><br />The Packers’ running game has been nonexistent (ranked 24th this season) ever since Ryan Grant got hurt — Aaron Rodgers was the leading rusher when the Packers last met the Falcons, in November — but for the playoffs they channeled their inner Lambeaus and Lombardis, grinding out long punishing drives to keep Michael Vick’s quick-strike offense off the field and surprising even Rodgers.<br /><br />One of the Ravens’ drives lasted 10 minutes 20 seconds in a game in which they outrushed the top-ranked rushing team in the N.F.L. One of the Jets’ drives lasted 9:54. Compare that with the Saints, whose running game ranked 28th in the regular season, and who had five running backs on injured reserve when they lined up against the Seahawks. They managed a long drive of just five minutes Saturday.<br /><br />“We have a quarterback that can stretch the field and make all the throws,” Packers Coach Mike McCarthy said. “But to win week in and week out, you got to have a combination of run and pass.”<br /><br />So, is rushing suddenly back in vogue? Not really. Just four of the top 10 rushing teams made the playoffs (Chiefs, Patriots, Jets, Eagles), and Philadelphia’s numbers are skewed because Vick often ends up running on called passing plays. The spoils of the regular season, then, still heavily favor those who pass. But when you think passing, you think Colts, and they were undone Saturday in large part because their run defense, which had been revived in the last four games of the regular season, wore down under the barrage of LaDainian Tomlinson and Shonn Greene.<br /><br />“The ability to run the ball is like sacks — when and where,” said the former Ravens Coach Brian Billick, an analyst for the NFL Network who won a Super Bowl in 2000 with a spectacular defense and 2,199 yards rushing. “The ability to run the ball at critical times — red zone, four minutes, third down and medium to short — is vital in tight games, like playoffs, because turnovers and big plays usually negate each other with the good teams that are playing in the postseason. Fundamentals are always more critical when both teams are good.”<br /><br />Expect to see more of it this weekend, when the Steelers, the Patriots, the Falcons and the Bears, all of whom had 1,000-yard rushers in the regular season, enter the playoffs.<br /><br />Colts Face Off-Season of Uncertainty<br /><br />When the Colts’ season ended Saturday night, it began a long, uncertain off-season for a team that is used to stability. With the collective bargaining agreement due to expire in early March, many teams are following the path the Giants owner John Mara discussed last week: waiting for a resolution before doing any contract extensions. There will be no free agency, no trades, no nothing if there is a lockout, but the Colts will most likely try to complete Peyton Manning’s next contract before that happens. (The Eagles are in the same spot with Michael Vick, although they could also give him the franchise tag for a year, assuming the tag is part of the next labor deal.) But there are other prominent Colts names — Joseph Addai, Adam Vinatieri, Clint Session — who have no contract after this season and who are most likely stuck in limbo until a new labor agreement is finished. If the deal is not done until late summer, a shorter free agency period is possible, creating what might be a condensed, frenzied signing and trading period. No trades could impact the Eagles, especially, because Kevin Kolb made it clear to Philadelphia reporters Sunday night that he does not want to be in Philadelphia as a backup any longer. Kolb is under contract, and if the Eagles wanted to trade him — a very big if, given the battering Vick took this season — they would have to wait for the new labor deal to start.<br /><br />Needs for the Eliminated<br /><br />Never too early to start pondering off-season needs for the eliminated teams:<br /><br />COLTS Do something about the running game to help Peyton Manning, especially upgrading the offensive line. Should the run defense get better, too? Yes, but the defense played well enough to beat the Jets, and it was the offense — surprise — that could not close them out.<br /><br />CHIEFS They badly need receivers to make a more balanced offense after Dwayne Bowe, who scored 15 touchdowns in the regular season, disappeared against the Ravens.<br /><br />EAGLES They have to shore up the offensive line to save Michael Vick from the battering that led him to limp through much of Sunday’s game and miss four regular-season games.<br /><br />SAINTS Whither Reggie Bush and the Saints’ running game? Like the underachieving pass rush, these concerns must be addressed for the Saints to challenge for another Super Bowl.
