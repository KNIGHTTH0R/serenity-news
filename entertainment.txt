To Some Dancers, ‘Black Swan’ is a Cautionary Tale|1|Jan. 07, 2011|Sarah Maslin Nir|CARMELLA IMRIE spent six grueling hours last Wednesday mastering steps like the brisé and jeté battu for Keith Michael’s ballet “The Alice-in-Wonderland Follies.” But instead of going home to nurse her toes afterward|, she and five other dancers with the New York Theater Ballet headed out to see “Black Swan.”<br />After sitting through the nearly two-hour-long thriller, Ms. Imrie, 27, left the AMC Loews theater in Kips Bay wanting to shake her arms, as if her skin were crawling. It wasn’t the gore of the bloodied tutus, but the psychological subtext. “It’s the destructive personality that makes it really creepy,” she said. “You don’t ever want to have that to become you.”<br /><br />“Black Swan,” which stars Natalie Portman as a ballerina whose rise to the top comes at the price of her sanity, has become something of a must-see movie for young ballerinas, not just because it is the rare Hollywood film that uses ballet as its central universe. Some dancers say that the film holds up a mirror to a darker side of ballet.<br /><br />The film’s director, Darren Aronofsky, might have set out to make a thriller, but for the dance community, the chills come from the unsettling topics he laid bare: the blind pursuit of perfection, the anorexia and bulimia to achieve a fat-free swanlike figure, the sexual abuse of fragile ingénues.<br /><br />Those tensions are embodied in Nina Sayers, a young ballerina played by Ms. Portman. The movie begins with Nina choking down an ascetic breakfast: one grapefruit. Later, she heaves her bony shoulders to retch in the ballet company’s bathroom, and refuses even a taste of a pink-frosted celebration cake her mother has bought her.<br /><br />The scene may be played with melodramatic effect, but its underlying pathos is familiar to ballet dancers. Tara Hutton, 21, a senior at Butler University in Indianapolis who is studying dance, said the specter of eating disorders haunts many of her classmates. Ballet, she said, can be a “sick and twisted art form” that puts an unrealistic value on “achieving this beautiful thin body.”<br /><br />At dance camps she attended growing up, drinking quarts of Crystal Light and cup after cup of coffee to tame hunger pangs was a common practice. Dancers who starve themselves also increase the likelihood of stress fractures and other injuries, she said. In one scene from the film, Nina’s toenails crack off in her toe shoes.<br /><br />“You see a dancer who is injured, and you can’t help but think twice about the fact that it could” be from eating disorders, said Ms. Hutton, who is preparing to audition for ballet companies in the Midwest this spring. “You’re working every day to achieve something that is physically impossible.”<br /><br />For Nina, the impossible reflects the demands of her smothering mother, a failed dancer herself who seeks vicarious fulfillment through her daughter.<br /><br />Cheryl Kaeser hesitated to let her daughter Emma, 15, a ballet student in Manhattan, see the movie. “I was concerned that it may show a particularly ugly side of ballet,” she said. Only recently has she decided to take Emma to the film, after serious consideration.<br /><br />The film also portrays ballet as a quixotic art form that demands nothing less than total submission to the craft. Nina pirouettes until her feet are bloodied, twirling before the barre so long into the night that the theater lights go out on her, and still she wants more. Hidden under her fashionable shrugs are angry red lines that she clawed into her skin, and her fingers are bandaged to hide the raw patches of skin she casually peels. The pressures dancers face rang true for Ellen Bar, a soloist with the New York City Ballet, who attended the film’s New York premiere with 30 dancers. “The psychological torture of being an artist” felt real, she said. “The way it shows an artist being her own worst enemy.”<br /><br />Jennifer Homans, a dance critic whose new history of ballet, “Apollo’s Angels,” has drawn critical applause, said that dance tends to draw people who have a kind of discipline and dedication that can flip into obsession. “They are obsessed with trying to make their bodies into something beautiful and special and otherworldly,” Ms. Homans said. “There is an enormous psychological pressure cooker there at a very young age.”<br /><br />Torture for Nina came also in the form of the sexual advances of her director, Thomas Leroy, played by Vincent Cassel. He slides a wanton hand down her leotard when teaching her a turn, and shoves his tongue into her mouth when she dares to slip into his office and ask for a better part.<br /><br />The dynamic has a historical precedent: the charismatic choreographer George Balanchine had a well-known weakness for his own dancers, reported in newspapers and tabloids during his time, and in books including “All in the Dances: A Brief Life of George Balanchine,” by Terry Teachout.<br /><br />“Is there a problem with a sort of dominant male figure and a woman under his power? Yes, that happens,” Ms. Homans said. But the problem, she added, might be exaggerated in cases of ballet companies filled with young female dancers and directed by men. “The outside world may glom on to this more in the dance world because it’s a physical art form, so the power relationships seem physical. They exist in all worlds, but they may seem to people more intense here.”<br /><br />Not everyone agrees with the gloomy picture of ballet that Mr. Aronofsky paints. They argue that the eating disorders and sexual exploits are stereotypes, and that the issues dancers face are over-dramatized to the point where the film borders on farce.<br /><br />Diana Byer, the artistic director of the New York Theater Ballet, said that movies that try to dramatize ballet usually miss the mark by turning actors into caricatures of tortured artists, obsessed and tormented by their craft. “Dancers are people, they have a job like everybody else,” she said during a break in rehearsal last week. “A person who doesn’t live life can’t bring anything to a ballet. You have to live life to create an art form.”<br /><br />Still, she made a point of seeing the movie soon after it came out, along with nearly everyone in her 14-member company. They debated Ms. Portman’s ballet techniques during breaks in practice, critiqued some of the dance performances and gushed over a few of the costumes. The fact is, it’s not every day that Hollywood portrays their art.<br /><br />Their biggest complaint about the film, she said, wasn’t the melodramatic portrayal, the inaccuracies or the ugly stereotypes. It was that there was not enough dancing in it.
‘Game’ on: More Real Than Reality TV|2|Jan. 07, 2011|Jon Caramanica|DURING its first three seasons “The Game,” the dramedy about professional football players and the women who barely tolerate them, overflowed with cameos by black celebrities. There were singers like Musiq, rappers like Soulja| Boy, athletes like Chad Ochocinco and more. Robin Givens and Rick Fox played themselves in recurring roles. These appearances added verisimilitude to a series already steeped in it. Few shows on television were as specific to their moment as “The Game.”<br />In the Season 4 premiere, Tuesday on BET, the surrounding culture has changed a bit. Near the end of the episode Tasha Mack (Wendy Raquel Robinson), gets a shock when meeting one of her boyfriend’s exes: Sheree Whitfield of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” playing herself.<br /><br />It’s timely casting, and also a bit of a wink. “The Game,” which had its premiere in 2006 — before the “Housewives” explosion, before every other football player and 1990s R&B star had dating shows — was, until its cancellation by the CW network in 2009, an inadvertent precursor to the boom in reality television about the semi-famous. Its demi-monde was the behind-the-scenes universe of modern celebrities, and its best material about the embarrassments that lay therein, giving the show a ripped-from-the-headlines quality. Now, 20 months after its Season 3 finale was broadcast on CW, “The Game” is returning to a world that, in a sense, it set the stage for.<br /><br />“One of our bigger competitors is reality TV,” said Mara Brock Akil, the show’s creator and an executive producer along with her husband, Salim, who added that the show was mindful of the changing times: “The digital age, YouTube, reality TV — everything is now, in the moment, in the second.”<br /><br />But no matter how au courant the show was, it was never a ratings success on CW, with an audience hovering in the range of two million. Rumors of cancellation plagued its third season, leading to a viral campaign to save it, featuring all of the show’s main actors, and to Ms. Akil’s attempt to reconceive it from a hald-hour to an hourlong drama more in keeping with the direction the network was moving in.<br /><br />“I’ve never been in an experience where everybody wanted so bad for it to work,” said Hosea Chanchez, who plays the manchild lothario quarterback Malik Wright. “We were more than colleagues, we were literally a family trying to imprint its fingerprint in society and show the world that we’re here.”<br /><br />None of it worked, though, and “The Game” was left in limbo. Ms. Akil became a consulting producer on “Cougar Town,” and Mr. Akil directed his first feature film, “Jumping the Broom,” scheduled for release in the spring. Coby Bell, who plays the spendthrift wide receiver Jason Pitts, became a regular on “Burn Notice,” and Pooch Hall, who plays the rising star Derwin Davis, took a role on “Accidentally on Purpose.” Tia Mowry, who plays Derwin’s wife, Melanie, worked on a TV movie and reality series with her twin sister, Tamera, with whom she starred in the 1990s sitcom “Sister, Sister.”<br /><br />Though Mr. Chanchez filmed roles in three movies, he said: “I felt like I had a death in the family, to be honest with you. For me, it was more of a deep depression I sunk into.”<br /><br />A few weeks after the cancellation was official, the Akils were approached by BET, looking to expand its original programming.<br /><br />“I thought, ‘Duh, we can do something about this,’ ” said Loretha Jones, BET’s president for original programming. BET was already showing reruns of “The Game,” with great success. “We had bigger numbers for our runs of the shows than the CW ever got,” Ms. Jones said.<br /><br />A deal was not quick in the making though. BET had no significant track record in original programming, and the show’s owner, CBS Paramount Network Television, was skeptical. “They did not know us to be a producer of original series at the level they produced the show,” Ms. Jones said. Nevertheless BET was able to secure the license, giving “The Game” a second chance.<br /><br />The cast was reunited, but some sacrifices had to be made. “We are doing scripted at a price point that is better than other networks do reality,” Ms. Jones said. For the Akils that meant changes. They now shoot out of sequence, for efficiency; have a slimmer writing staff, drawn from the original team; and have moved production to Atlanta from Los Angeles to take advantage of tax breaks. (Atlanta is also a hub for black celebrity life. Being there, Mr. Akil said, allowed the cast “to experience their celebrity in full bloom.”)<br /><br />But these adjustments were small compared to the ones the Akils had envisioned when trying to reimagine the show as an hourlong drama. No amount of tweaking could have turned the show’s cast members into moody, misbehaving teenagers or moody, misbehaving vampires.<br /><br />Or make them white. Scripted shows with predominantly black casts are virtually nonexistent on contemporary network TV. Apart from the slate of TBS comedies under Tyler Perry’s umbrella, they’re hard to find on cable too. “Are we that insignificant and don’t matter, and it’s O.K. that we’re disappearing from the screens?” Ms. Robinson asked.<br /><br />Mr. Chanchez, who recalled watching diverse black characters on network shows while growing up, said: “I’m saddened for the generation of young black men that come behind me. TV exposes you to a world outside your own. I knew about complex relationships because of ‘Martin.’ I learned there were black doctors because of ‘The Cosby Show.’ ”<br /><br />For now, then, there’s “The Game,” a happily heretical and saucy show that has always joyfully poked at racial orthodoxies, giving Jason Pitts a white wife, Kelly (Brittany Daniel), and once importing Prof. Michael Eric Dyson to dress down Malik for his oafish behavior. Mr. Akil likens the show’s frisky treatment of race to the tone of “All in the Family”: “The reason people like it is they hear some of this stuff in the privacy of their homes.”<br /><br />It’s bold, especially for BET, which is better known as a home for music videos and, lately, hand-me-down reality show concepts. “We want to shine for BET,” Ms Akil said. “They’ve gotten a lot of criticism over the years.”<br /><br />For BET taking on “The Game” is a significant financial outlay, and also a leap of faith that the show can keep the trust of an already loyal audience. “If we mess that up,” Ms. Jones said, “it will be hard to convince them to stay with us for future shows.” (The return of “The Game” coincides with the debut of the original BET sitcom “Let’s Stay Together.”) BET hasn’t formally committed to a second season, but, Ms. Jones said, “I’ve informally let them know that we’re interested in more scripts.”<br /><br />Ms. Jones said she hoped original programming would “live in tandem” with BET’s reality offerings. Or maybe “The Game” can cover both. This season’s masterstroke may be the inclusion of a reality show within the show. Jason’s ex-wife Kelly, living fat off her divorce settlement, is trailed by cameras throughout the premiere episode — another sharp reminder of who got there first, and that fiction is the lie that tells the truth.
Real Guitar Hero, Through the Years|3|Jan. 08, 2011|Stephen Holden|Although Bucky Pizzarelli, the guest of honor at the 92Y Lyrics & Lyricists season-opening program on Saturday, didn’t amble onto the stage until the second half of the evening, his voice was heard in recorded sound| bites jovially reminiscing about his life and times as a session guitarist.<br />The show’s title, “Frank and Tony and Peggy and Me: Making Music With the Great Singers,” referred to Mr. Pizzarelli’s multidecade status as a preferred sideman to the stars, including Sinatra, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Lee. Its M.C., his son John, who has a way with a pun, wittily described his father, who recently had his gall bladder removed, as Less Gall (after Les Paul). John’s easygoing humor lent the show the same lift that infuses all his performances, reminding you that ensemble jazz can be a kind of familial high, even if the other musicians aren’t all blood relatives.<br /><br />The show jelled the moment Bucky, who turned 85 on Sunday, and John began playing guitar duets. A humorous “Honeysuckle Rose” gave way to “Sing, Sing, Sing,” with the house band — in which Ken Peplowski saluted Benny Goodman’s spiraling clarinet, and the drummer Tony Tedesco recalled Gene Krupa — bringing the staid audience to its feet. Filling out the quintet were the young jazz violin whiz Aaron Weinstein, Larry Fuller (the pianist in John’s group for the last five years) and Martin Pizzarelli (Bucky’s younger son) on bass.<br /><br />John Pizzarelli’s group, one the finest traditional ensembles in all of jazz, has refined a light, lilting swing style whose steady, subtle bounce evokes a musical-cosmic trampoline on which you float rather than jump. The father-and-son showpieces were connected by Bucky’s gently lyrical solo, “This Nearly Was Mine,” fleshed out with jazz chords and blues-inflected embellishments.<br /><br />The first act was a career retrospective, narrated by John and illustrated by slides, that carried Bucky from the swing era through his days as a sought-after rock-’n’-roll session guitarist. The guest singers Jessica Molaskey (John’s wife and his co-artistic director for the show), Judy Kuhn and Darius de Hass sang tongue-in-cheek renditions of hits of Dion and the Belmonts, the Four Seasons, Leiber and Stoller and Neil Sedaka on which Bucky had played guitar.<br /><br />In Act II they returned for more serious renditions of “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” (Ms. Kuhn), “Georgia on My Mind” (Mr. de Haas) and “Cry Me a River” (Ms. Molaskey).<br /><br />A loving birthday message from Dion DiMucci was read. Later John played a specially revised version of Dave Frishberg’s “I Want to Be a Sideman,” for which Mr. Frishberg had written a lighthearted new verse in praise of Bucky. Without high drama, flashy star turns and conspicuous one-upmanship, the show led you inside a cozy family circle where the joy of music making was an end in itself.<br /><br />“Frank and Tony and Peggy and Me” continues through Monday at the 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue; (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org.
Changing Sexes, Species and More|4|Jan. 09, 2011|Neil Genzlinger|“Pants on Fire’s Metamorphoses” sounds as if it’s the kind of show that requires you to do a little homework before turning up at the theater. But it isn’t. The user-friendliness is terrific, though it also ends| up being something of a limitation.<br />The work is an unconventional retelling of some of Ovid’s tales of transformation, but there’s no need to dig out your old textbooks. Part of the fun, it turns out, is being reintroduced to figures you may have last encountered in a high school classroom and realizing how thoroughly settled in your memory bank they are.<br /><br />The other part of the fun is the witty, low-tech staging by Pants on Fire, a London company that took this show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last year and came away with the Best of Edinburgh Award. The Flea Theater, where the production is being staged, isn’t very big, but what this company does with four simple flats makes it magical nonetheless: characters appear seemingly out of nowhere, change sexes before your eyes and more.<br /><br />Not that this production, conceived and directed by Peter Bramley, is entirely shoestring. It includes assorted video elements, including a wonderful film that puts a Hollywood spin on Narcissus’s tale of self-love. It’s a black-and-white film because all of these stories are transported to the World War II years, with uniformed soldiers and nurses, allusions to Hitler and the occasional song (by Lucy Egger) done in stylings of the period.<br /><br />The most engrossing vignette focuses on Io (Mabel Jones), the young maiden lusted after by Jupiter (Jonathan Davenport), turned into a heifer and given to the spiteful Juno (Jo Dockery). A World War II-era gas mask is the perfect prop to effect the transformation, and Ms. Jones makes a remarkably touching go of it considering the monstrosity she’s wearing on her head.<br /><br />Compared with this clever and convincing bit, the beheading of Medusa (Eloise Secker) that comes shortly after is a letdown. But that feels like nitpicking. So, perhaps, does the overall complaint about the show: that it begins to seem like something created to make the classics palatable to high schoolers, with more dazzle than depth. By the end you’re mentally beginning to answer the obvious essay question: “Explain why the creators chose to set the show in World War II. Support your answer with examples of the transformations in Ovid and during the war years, and discuss the similarities between love, as practiced by the gods, and war.”
A TV-Internet Marriage Awaits Blessings of All Parties|5|Jan. 09, 2011|Brian Stelter|LAS VEGAS — The blending of television and the Internet is inevitable. But will it happen in concert with the major cable and satellite distributors, or in spite of them?<br />That question loomed large at the Consumer Electronics Show| last week as manufacturers promoted Internet-connected television sets and companies like Cisco and Sony talked about “redefining television.” All involved know that connecting the Internet to television and vice versa could solidify the distributors’ place in the food chain — or greatly erode it.<br /><br />“We want to use all this technology to make a better consumer experience,” Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said in an interview after speaking on stage here. A better experience, it stands to reason, will help Time Warner Cable and other cable companies retain customers, protecting the lucrative subscription TV business from the prospect of cord-cutting. It will also help manufacturers sell more hardware for the living room.<br /><br />During the trade show, however, there was a point in every demonstration where fantasy collided with reality — and it was usually when the cable and satellite distributors came up.<br /><br />“The idea here is to work with cable,” said Google’s Rishi Chandra as he showed off Google TV to Julius Genachowski, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, on Friday afternoon. When working together, Google TV can seamlessly find live television channels, recorded shows, on-demand options and Web streams. So far, though, it works that way only with Dish Network.<br /><br />“Right now,” Mr. Chandra said, “we’re limited.”<br /><br />After seeing television setups at the show, Mr. Genachowski said, “They’re incentivizing the cable companies to innovate.”<br /><br />At the show, media and technology executives largely agreed with that sentiment. And signs of innovation were evident: Time Warner Cable, one of the biggest cable operators, announced that it would start delivering programming via its network straight into some Sony and Samsung television sets, removing the need for a set-top cable television box.<br /><br />The so-called smart TVs receive video via the Internet, protect the video as directed by the content owners, and display it all with a program guide that is much slicker than the ones that most people are saddled with now. Time Warner Cable customers who buy the television sets will have a cable television app on the program guide next to a YouTube app and a Facebook app, all tied together by a search bar.<br /><br />Many distributors “will have an app for us” over time, predicted Stuart Silloway, a training manager for Samsung Electronics America.<br /><br />Also last week, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced that they would replicate their live channel lineups on tablet computers. Other distributors like Verizon and Cablevision are working on similar features. (Of course, the channels themselves are also scurrying to reach consumers on tablets, too.)<br /><br />The move onto tablets is part of a recognition by the Comcasts and Verizons of the world that they have to keep up with changing consumer habits.<br /><br />“If you buy a video subscription from us in your home, our goal is to make the video available on all your devices,” Mr. Britt of Time Warner said, echoing the goal of the “TV Everywhere” concept espoused by his and other companies. He added, “People don’t see PCs and phones and tablets and TVs as different things. They are all just video display devices.”<br /><br />Making a television subscription available on all those devices is wrenchingly difficult, because of a maze of copyrights and sometimes contradictory content strategies. At first, the live streams to tablets will be available only in customers’ homes, the distributors indicated last week. But that is still progress.<br /><br />Stand-alone boxes that bring the Internet to big-screen TVs have not caught on with the public, but including that functionality in televisions may make it more popular.<br /><br />It was learned last week that the remote controls for some Blu-ray players and connected televisions will come with red Netflix buttons this year, which is sure to “cause some consternation among those concerned about cable service cord-cutting,” wrote David Joyce of Miller Tabak and Company in an analyst’s note. But Mr. Joyce is optimistic that cable and satellite companies will adapt.<br /><br />Sensing a big business opportunity, companies are lining up to bolster “TV Everywhere” and, thus, the cable companies. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, proclaimed at a news conference Wednesday that “video is the next voice.” He said that Cisco had a software and hardware architecture package called Videoscape to blend television and Internet video sources.<br /><br />In demonstrations, Cisco imagined an on-screen guide with three columns — the largest column being the television channels provided by the distributor, the second column being Web content, and the third being videos and photos from friends and family members. That guide was replicated on laptops, tablets and smartphones.<br /><br />Cisco and Motorola, with a prototype of something it called “MediOS,” want customers to be able to quickly shift a television show or a Web video from one screen to another, and to be able to see what friends are watching at the same time. But that will take deals with distributors — and big investments.<br /><br />As an example, the Google TV setup works well when it is fully tied into a distributors’ system, as it is with Dish Network. “But because there’s no integrated ability to control tuners — to stream content — it’s not standard,” Mr. Chandra told Mr. Genachowski on Friday during a tour of the trade show floor. “It’s going to take years and years and years to negotiate the integrations,” Mr. Chandra added.<br /><br />For content owners, it is a confusing time. At the trade show, companies like News Corporation and the CBS Corporation held court with all manner of manufacturers and in a couple of cases announced new pacts. CBS will soon start allowing users of Boxee, an Internet television software package, to buy episodes of shows like “CSI.”<br /><br />One senior media executive deemed the Internet TV marketplace a “jump ball,” with television makers, distributors and content owners all participating. “That’s why we have to talk to everybody,” said the executive, who insisted on anonymity because those talks are private.<br /><br />What is still lacking, in large part, is consumer education about Internet-connected TVs — but that will change. The Sony chief executive, Howard Stringer, announced Wednesday that Sony would start a worldwide advertising campaign called “Television Redefined” this year.<br /><br />“The next evolution is upon us: the marriage of the television and the Internet,” he said that day, without specifying who would officiate at the wedding.
Twin Alone, Disconnected but Not Lost|6|Jan. 09, 2011|Michiko Kakutani|The formative event in the composer Allen Shawn’s life happened when he was 8 years old: His twin sister, Mary, who was mentally disabled, was sent away, abruptly disappearing from his daily life. Allen| not only missed her terribly, but he also became terrified of “the mental illness that Mary had exhibited, and which had led, or so it had seemed to me as a child, to her being ‘ostracized’ from the family.<br /><br />“I suppose that as her twin, it was doubly hard for me to know how and where to draw the boundary line between her nature and mine, between the inherent strangeness of being a person and the kind of strangeness that led to what I saw as banishment from normal human society.”<br /><br />Mr. Shawn himself suffers from myriad phobias and fears, and in the years that followed, he writes in his extraordinary new book, “Twin,” he would often find himself “wondering if it was only a matter of time before the magic glue that held my own brain together would lose its adhesive properties, and I would join the lines of shuffling institutional dependents at Briarcliff,” an invented name for the place where Mary lives.<br /><br />When Mr. Shawn suffered panic attacks, he felt as if he were turning into his sister, “as if the unchained spirit of her distress was no longer being held down and was erupting like a monster inside me.”<br /><br />Like his 2007 memoir, “Wish I Could Be There,” in which Mr. Shawn dissected the sources of his own many phobias, this volume is an unsparing but deeply compassionate inquiry into his family’s life. It’s a book that combines the sympathetic insight of Oliver Sacks’s writings with Joan Didion’s autobiographical candor and Mary Karr’s sense of familial dynamics — a book that leaves the reader with a haunting sense of how relationships between brothers and sisters, and parents and children, can irrevocably bend the arc of an individual’s life, how childhood dynamics can shape one’s apprehension of the world.<br /><br />As he did in “Wish I Could Be There,” Mr. Shawn grounds his story in scientific and medical research, in this case giving the reader an overview of scholarship on autism and how disparate theories may illuminate its causes and manifestations. His aim is to come as close as he can to understanding Mary’s inner life: to apprehend why she has such difficulty communicating with others; why ritual and routine and repetition are so necessary for her: “I can’t help but think that this need for certainty originates in a sense of confusion not unlike mine when I am traveling, the experience of being overwhelmed by impressions and sensations.”<br /><br />Mr. Shawn’s need to reconnect with Mary, he explains, stems from the intensity of his original relationship with her — as twins, they had spent their early months “lying next to each other in the same crib, and had grown up in our first years” as playmates — and “the abruptness with which our lives had diverged.” They were separated when their parents — Cecille and William Shawn, the legendary editor of The New Yorker magazine — realized that “there was something wrong with Mary.”<br /><br />“First she was down the hall from me, keeping my brother up at night with her screams,” Shawn writes. “As she increasingly became the center of family concerns — a source of worry and anxiety and exhaustion — our original togetherness became increasingly painful to mention. Then she was simply absent, reduced to a kind of shimmering nostalgic image, an essentially static, mythical being: always ‘improving,’ yet always staying the same and never actually getting anywhere.”<br /><br />The Shawn home, with its emphasis (like The New Yorker’s) on discretion and decorum, magnified neuroses. The author’s father suffered from an array of phobias that made it hard for him to travel or attend large gatherings, while his overprotective mother seemed reluctant to let him grow up. She even chaperoned his taste in music, “instituting a rule that I could only listen to one jazz record for every three classical ones.”<br /><br />There was also a great, unspoken secret in the Shawn household: his father’s continuing extramarital affair with a woman who worked at The New Yorker — an affair that would last for 40 years and involve an adopted child. Later Allen Shawn would wonder if the problems with Mary contributed to his father’s “turning partially away from the family,” adding that while he doesn’t believe that “these additional pressures caused Mary’s institutionalization,” they certainly “contributed to the shaky marital environment in which the decisions” about her were being made.<br /><br />As children, both Allen and his older brother, Wallace — who would grow up to become the author of plays like “Aunt Dan and Lemon,” “The Fever” and “The Designated Mourner” — sensed an undertow of emotional intensity in the family that their parents “strenuously denied was there.” And Allen Shawn speculates that “the unseen sides of our family’s life — our sister’s disability and absence, our parents’ psychological and marital struggles — were probably fueling my brother’s and my creative efforts, since precisely those aspects of life that seemed generally absent from family talk and from the magazine — the tasteless, the lurid, the unreasonable, the violent, the uncontrollable, the personal, the psychological — seemed most fascinating.”<br /><br />For Allen Shawn music provided a way to recapture the nonverbal communication he once shared with Mary. “Like any twins,” he writes, “we had developed a way of communicating in a language of gestures, looks and vocal inflections.” Starting at the age of 12 or 13, he recalls, “a musical form would appear in my mind the way a steak appears in a thought bubble over the head of a comic-strip dog: I would feel an appetite to create music that would fill a particular shape. Melodies would come to me easily when I sat down to compose, as if they had been there all along but had been drowned out by the din of life.”<br /><br />Music, he says, is less a way of “deliberately expressing particular emotions, but about discovering them,” and this “need to ‘discover,’ ” he goes on, surely stemmed from his “lost twinship.” Mary’s absence, he says, “had been left largely undiscussed and papered over in our family life. Something essential in me had been papered over too, and music was my one means of access to it.”<br /><br />On the way to visit Mary at Briarcliff five years ago, Mr. Shawn says, he realized that he was “carrying the burden” of the decision his parents “had made all of those years ago, one I am sure they agonized over and continued to agonize over ever after, to send their child to live away from the family. I carried their agony with me and I carried their guilt, and I felt both their guilt and my own guilt at having been ‘spared.’ ”<br /><br />This deeply affecting book, like the author’s music, is both a love letter to his twin sister and an intimate reconstruction of the toppling emotional dominoes that her institutionalization set in play in their family more than half a century ago.
